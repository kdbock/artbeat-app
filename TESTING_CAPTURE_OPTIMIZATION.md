## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Happy Path - Fast Network

**Setup:**

- Good internet connection
- Logged in user
- Camera/photo access granted

**Steps:**

1. Open the app
2. Navigate to Capture screen

- ‚úÖ Background operations complete within 10 seconds
- ‚úÖ All data is saved correctly

---

### Test 3: Multiple Rapid Captures

**Setup:**

- Good internet connection
- Logged in user

**Steps:**

1. Submit first capture
2. As soon as success dialog appears, tap "Go to Dashboard"
3. Immediately navigate back to Capture
4. Submit second capture
5. Repeat for third capture

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ All three captures are saved
- ‚úÖ Each shows success dialog quickly
- ‚úÖ No errors or crashes
- ‚úÖ All background operations complete for all captures
- ‚úÖ User stats reflect all three captures

---

### Test 4: Error Handling - Network Interruption

**Setup:**

- Start with good connection
- Prepare to disable network mid-process

**Steps:**

1. Start capture submission
2. Disable network after image upload but before completion
3. Observe behavior

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ If Firestore save fails, user sees error message
- ‚úÖ If Firestore save succeeds but background ops fail, user still sees success
- ‚úÖ Background operations retry or fail gracefully
- ‚úÖ No app crashes

---

### Test 5: Background Operations Verification

**Setup:**

- Good internet connection
- Fresh user account or known XP/stats

**Steps:**

1. Note current user stats:
   - Capture count
   - XP amount
   - Weekly goals progress
   - Activity feed
2. Submit a capture
3. Wait 5 seconds after success dialog
4. Check all stats again

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Capture count: +1
- ‚úÖ XP: Increased (check exact amount in rewards service)
- ‚úÖ Weekly goals: Photography goal progress increased
- ‚úÖ Activity feed: New post appears
- ‚úÖ Challenges: Photo capture recorded

---

### Test 6: Public vs Private Captures

**Setup:**

- Test both public and private captures

**Steps:**

1. Submit a public capture (accept disclaimer)
2. Check publicArt collection
3. Submit a private capture (don't accept disclaimer - if supported)

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Public capture appears in publicArt collection
- ‚úÖ Social activity posted for public capture
- ‚úÖ Private capture does NOT appear in publicArt
- ‚úÖ No social activity for private capture

---

### Test 7: Navigation During Background Processing

**Setup:**

- Good internet connection

**Steps:**

1. Submit a capture
2. As soon as success dialog appears, tap "Go to Dashboard"
3. Immediately navigate to different screens (Profile, Art Walks, etc.)
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Check if background operations completed

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ User can navigate freely
- ‚úÖ No UI freezing or lag
- ‚úÖ Background operations complete successfully
- ‚úÖ All stats are updated correctly

---

### Test 8: Error in Background Operations

**Setup:**

- Simulate error in one background operation (may require code modification for testing)

**Steps:**

1. Submit a capture
2. Observe logs

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Capture is still saved
- ‚úÖ User sees success dialog
- ‚úÖ Error is logged but doesn't crash app
- ‚úÖ Other background operations continue
- ‚úÖ User experience is not affected

---

## üìã Verification Checklist

After running all tests, verify:

### Database

- [ ] Captures are saved in `captures` collection
- [ ] Public captures are saved in `publicArt` collection
- [ ] User document has updated capture count
- [ ] User document has updated XP

### User Interface

- [ ] Success dialog appears quickly (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Loading states are clear
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly

### Background Operations

- [ ] XP is awarded
- [ ] Achievements are checked
- [ ] Weekly goals are updated
- [ ] Social activity is posted
- [ ] Challenges are recorded

### Error Handling

- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Partial failures don't break the flow
- [ ] Logs show clear error messages
- [ ] User is not affected by non-critical errors

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Logs

Look for these log messages:

**Success Indicators:**

```
‚úÖ StorageService: Capture image upload successful
‚úÖ CaptureService: Capture saved to Firestore
‚úÖ Recorded photo capture for daily challenges
‚úÖ Updated weekly goals for photo capture
‚úÖ Posted social activity for capture
‚úÖ All post-capture operations completed
```

**Error Indicators:**

```
‚ùå Error incrementing user capture count: [error details]
‚ùå Error awarding XP: [error details]
‚ùå Error posting social activity: [error details]
```

### Performance Metrics

Measure these times:

- **Image Upload:** Should be 0.5-2 seconds (depends on image size and network)
- **Firestore Save:** Should be 0.2-0.5 seconds
- **Total UI Blocking:** Should be < 2 seconds
- **Background Completion:** Should be 2-5 seconds

### Firebase Console

Check these collections:

1. **captures** - New capture document exists
2. **publicArt** - Public capture appears here
3. **users/{userId}** - captureCount incremented, XP increased
4. **activities** - Social activity posted
5. **weeklyGoals** - Progress updated

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Success dialog takes > 3 seconds

**Possible Causes:**

- Slow network connection
- Large image file
- Firebase latency

**Solutions:**

- Check network speed
- Verify image compression is working
- Check Firebase console for issues

### Issue: Background operations not completing

**Possible Causes:**

- Network disconnected after save
- Firebase permissions issue
- Service initialization error

**Solutions:**

- Check logs for specific errors
- Verify Firebase rules allow writes
- Check user authentication

### Issue: XP not awarded

**Possible Causes:**

- RewardsService error
- Background operation failed

**Solutions:**

- Check logs for "Error awarding XP"
- Verify RewardsService is initialized
- Check Firebase connection

### Issue: Social activity not posted

**Possible Causes:**

- Capture is not public
- User model not found
- SocialService error

**Solutions:**

- Verify capture.isPublic is true
- Check user is logged in
- Check logs for social activity errors
