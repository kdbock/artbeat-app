## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Bypassed GitHub Actions

**Decision:** Focus on local testing and app store prep instead of waiting for CI/CD  
**Rationale:** CI/CD is nice-to-have for automation, but not blocking for production launch  
**Impact:** Can proceed immediately with testing and preparation

### 2. Created Comprehensive Guides

**Decision:** Create detailed, step-by-step guides for every phase  
**Rationale:** Reduce confusion, provide clear path forward, save time  
**Impact:** Clear 3-week roadmap with no ambiguity

### 3. Prioritized Testing First

**Decision:** Test the release build before creating store assets  
**Rationale:** No point in creating screenshots if app has critical bugs  
**Impact:** Ensures quality before investing time in marketing materials

### 4. Structured 3-Week Timeline

**Decision:** Break down launch into manageable weekly phases  
**Rationale:** Prevents overwhelm, provides clear milestones  
**Impact:** Realistic timeline with built-in buffer for issues
