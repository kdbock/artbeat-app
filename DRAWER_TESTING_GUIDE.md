# 🍔 Drawer Navigation Testing Guide

## ✅ **Implementation Complete!**

The hamburger menu and drawer navigation have been successfully implemented. Here's how to test and verify the functionality:

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### 1. **Hamburger Menu Icon (☰)**
- **Location**: Top-left corner of the dashboard screen
- **Appearance**: Three horizontal lines (hamburger icon)
- **Action**: Tap to open the navigation drawer

### 2. **Navigation Drawer**
- **Opens from**: Left side of the screen
- **Contains**: Organized sections with navigation items
- **Closes**: Automatically when you tap a navigation item

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### Step 1: Open Dashboard Screen
1. Launch the ARTbeat app
2. Navigate to the dashboard screen
3. Look for the hamburger menu icon (☰) in the top-left corner of the header

### Step 2: Test Drawer Opening
1. Tap the hamburger menu icon
2. The drawer should slide in from the left
3. You should see organized sections: User, Artist, Gallery, Settings

### Step 3: Test Navigation Items
Try navigating to different sections:

**User Section:**
- ✅ View Profile → Should open profile view
- ✅ Edit Profile → Should open profile editing
- ✅ Captures → Should show user captures
- ✅ Achievements → Should display achievements
- ✅ Applause → Should show favorites/liked items
- ✅ Following → Should show following list

**Artist Section:**
- ✅ Artist Dashboard → Should open artist dashboard
- ✅ Edit Artist Profile → Should open artist profile editor
- ✅ View Public Profile → Should show public artist profile
- ✅ Artist Analytics → Should display analytics
- ✅ Artist Approved Ads → Should show ads management (coming soon screen)

**Gallery Section:**
- ✅ Artists Management → Should open artist management
- ✅ Gallery Analytics → Should show gallery analytics

**Settings Section:**
- ✅ Account Settings → Should open account settings
- ✅ Notification Settings → Should open notification preferences
- ✅ Privacy Settings → Should open privacy controls
- ✅ Security Settings → Should open security options
- ✅ Help & Support → Should open help section

### Step 4: Test Universal Navigation
Each screen accessed through the drawer should have:
- ✅ **Header with hamburger menu** (can access drawer from any screen)
- ✅ **Bottom navigation bar** (universal navigation)
- ✅ **Consistent styling** (same theme and layout)

### Step 5: Test Logout
1. Open drawer
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Tap "Sign Out"
4. Should log out and redirect to login screen

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### If Hamburger Menu Doesn't Appear:
1. **Check the header**: Make sure `ArtbeatAppHeader(showDrawerIcon: true)` is used
2. **Verify drawer**: Ensure `drawer: const ArtbeatDrawer()` is added to Scaffold
3. **Restart app**: Sometimes a hot reload is needed

### If Drawer Doesn't Open:
1. **Tap the hamburger icon** (not just anywhere on the header)
2. **Check for overlays**: Make sure no other UI elements are blocking
3. **Try swiping**: You can also swipe from the left edge of the screen

### If Navigation Doesn't Work:
1. **Check routes**: Ensure all routes are properly defined in `app.dart`
2. **Verify imports**: Make sure all screen packages are imported
3. **Check parameters**: Some screens require user IDs or other parameters

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Smooth Animation**: Drawer should slide in/out smoothly
2. **Auto-Close**: Drawer closes automatically when you tap a navigation item
3. **Visual Feedback**: Selected items should show appropriate visual feedback
4. **Consistent Navigation**: All screens maintain the same navigation elements
5. **Proper Routing**: Each drawer item navigates to the correct screen

## 📱 **Testing on Different Screens:**

The hamburger menu should appear on any screen that includes:
```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: const ArtbeatAppHeader(showDrawerIcon: true),
  drawer: const ArtbeatDrawer(),
  // ... rest of screen content
)
```

## 🚀 **Ready for Production:**

Once all tests pass, the drawer navigation system is ready for production use. Users will have intuitive access to all major app sections through the organized drawer interface.
