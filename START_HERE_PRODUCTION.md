## 🚨 Common Questions

### Q: How long until I can launch?

**A:** 3 weeks if you follow the plan systematically. Could be faster if you work full-time on it.

### Q: What if I find critical bugs?

**A:** Document them, fix them, re-test. Don't rush to production with known critical bugs.

### Q: Do I need to do beta testing?

**A:** Highly recommended! Beta testing catches issues you won't find yourself. Aim for 20-50 testers.

### Q: What if my app gets rejected?

**A:** Common on first submission. Read the rejection reason, fix the issue, resubmit. Usually takes 1-2 days.

### Q: Can I skip the screenshots?

**A:** No, screenshots are required by both stores. They're also crucial for conversions.

### Q: Do I need a privacy policy?

**A:** Yes, it's required by both App Store and Google Play. See templates in the guides.

### Q: What about iOS? I only see Android APK.

**A:** iOS build requires a Mac with Xcode. If you have one, run:

```bash
flutter build ipa --release
```

### Q: How do I know if I'm ready to submit?

**A:** Check `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`. If all items are checked, you're ready!
