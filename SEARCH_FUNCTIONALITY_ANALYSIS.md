  - Clear button (X icon) in search bar
  - Clears query and results immediately
  - Resets to empty state

#### 4. **Navigation to Search**

- **Location**: `/packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/widgets/enhanced_universal_header.dart:232`
- **Status**: ✅ Works
- **Details**:
  - Search icon in header navigates to `/search` route
  - Properly routed in `app_router.dart`

#### 5. **Search Cache**

- **Location**: `/packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/services/search/search_cache.dart`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**:
  - 15-minute TTL cache
  - Singleton pattern
  - Automatic cleanup

#### 6. **Search History Service**

- **Status**: ✅ Service implemented
- **Details**:
  - Stores up to 20 search queries
  - Stores filters with each search

---

### ❌ MISSING FEATURES

#### 1. **Search History Display**

- **Expected**: Show recent searches when search page loads (empty state)
- **Current**: Just shows generic "Discover Amazing Art" message
- **Impact**: Users can't quickly re-search recent queries
- **Fix Required**: Add `SearchHistory.getSearchHistory()` to empty state and display as chips/list

#### 2. **Community Search**

- **Expected**: Search community posts, artists directory, etc.
- **Current**: Not in `KnownEntityRepository.search()` (line 27-32)
- **Impact**: Can't find community content
- **Collections Missing**:
  - `community_posts`
  - `artist_directory`
  - `sponsorships`

#### 3. **Capture Search**

- **Expected**: Search user captures/photos
- **Current**: Uses `CaptureService.getAllCaptures()` but limited to 100 items, no query filtering
- **Impact**: Can't search for specific captures
- **Fix Required**: Add query filtering to capture search in `_searchArtwork()` method

#### 4. **Location Search**

- **Expected**: Search for gallery locations, venues, etc.
- **Current**: `KnownEntityType.location` exists but repository never searches locations
- **Impact**: Location search always returns empty
- **Fix Required**: Implement `_searchLocations()` method in repository

#### 5. **Search Filters**

- **Expected**: Filter by date, artist, price, etc.
- **Current**: No filter UI or logic
- **Impact**: Can't refine results
- **Needed**:
  - Filter chips (All, Artist, Artwork, Events, ArtWalks)
  - Date range filter
  - Sort options (Recent, Popular, Trending)

#### 6. **Dedicated Search Screens**

- **Expected**: Separate screens for Art Walk search, Event search, etc.
- **Current**: All searches go through global SearchResultsPage
- **Impact**: Limited domain-specific search features
- **Existing Screens**:
  - `packages/artbeat_art_walk/lib/src/screens/search_results_screen.dart` - ✅ Exists
  - `packages/artbeat_events/lib/src/screens/event_search_screen.dart` - ✅ Exists
  - **Not fully integrated** into main navigation

---

### ⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

#### 1. **Art Walk Search**

- **Status**: ✅ Works in global search but dedicated screen exists
- **Dedicated Screen**: `art_walk_search_filter.dart` exists but not fully used
- **Issue**: Should use dedicated screen with advanced filters

#### 2. **Event Search**

- **Status**: ✅ Works in global search
- **Dedicated Screen**: `event_search_screen.dart` exists
- **Issue**: Not linked from global search

#### 3. **Artist Search**

- **Status**: ✅ Works in global search but searches both `users` and `artist_profiles` collections
- **Issue**: Might return duplicates or inconsistent results

## 🔧 Code Quality Issues

### Repository Search Method

**File**: `/packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/repositories/known_entity_repository.dart`

```dart
// Lines 27-32: Only searches 4 types
final futures = <Future<List<KnownEntity>>>[
  _searchArtists(lowerQuery),
  _searchArtwork(lowerQuery),
  _searchArtWalks(lowerQuery),
  _searchEvents(lowerQuery),
  // ❌ Missing: _searchCommunity, _searchLocations
];
```

### Search Results Page Empty State

**File**: `/packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/screens/search_results_page.dart:181-245`

```dart
Widget _buildEmptyState() {
  return Center(
    child: Container(
      // ... beautiful UI but...
      child: Column(
        // ❌ Should show search history here
        // ❌ Should show suggested searches here
        children: [
          // Generic message instead
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## 📝 Recommendations

### Priority 1 - Critical (Breaks Features)

1. **Integrate SearchHistory display** into empty state
   - Show recent 5 searches as tappable chips
   - Add "Clear History" button
2. **Implement Capture filtering** in artwork search
   - Modify `_searchArtwork()` to filter captures by query
   - Currently uses `getAllCaptures(limit: 100)` without query filtering

### Priority 2 - Important (Missing Features)

1. **Add Community search** to repository

   - Implement `_searchCommunity()` method
   - Search posts, artists directory, studios

2. **Add Location search** to repository

   - Implement `_searchLocations()` method
   - Search galleries, venues, studios

3. **Add search filters UI**
   - Filter chips (All, Artist, Artwork, Events, etc.)
   - Sort options

### Priority 3 - Polish (UX Improvements)

1. **Link dedicated search screens**

   - Use EventSearchScreen for event search
   - Use ArtWalkSearchFilter for art walk search
   - Add custom search UI for each domain

2. **Add search suggestions**

   - Trending searches
   - "Did you mean?" for typos

3. **Add search analytics**
   - Track popular searches
   - Track search engagement
