# Art Walk Crash Fix Summary

## Problem

Users reported that the app crashes after walking for about 2-3 minutes during art walk completion. The crash was likely caused by:

1. **Excessive location tracking**: High-accuracy GPS with 5-meter distance filter causing battery drain
2. **Background location issues**: App trying to continue tracking when going to background
3. **Memory leaks**: Location streams and timers not properly disposed
4. **Permission issues**: Requesting "Always" location permission which is heavily restricted
5. **Hanging operations**: Art walk completion process could hang indefinitely

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Location Tracking Optimization (`art_walk_navigation_service.dart`)

**Before:**

```dart
const LocationSettings locationSettings = LocationSettings(
  accuracy: LocationAccuracy.high,
  distanceFilter: 5, // Update every 5 meters
);
```

**After:**

```dart
const LocationSettings locationSettings = LocationSettings(
  accuracy: LocationAccuracy.medium, // Reduced from high to medium
  distanceFilter: 10, // Increased from 5 to 10 meters to reduce updates
  timeLimit: Duration(minutes: 30), // Add time limit to prevent indefinite tracking
);
```

### 2. Better Error Handling and Recovery

- Added error handling for location stream failures
- Implemented automatic restart of location monitoring after errors
- Added safety timer to prevent indefinite location tracking

### 3. Improved Resource Cleanup

**Enhanced dispose method:**

```dart
void dispose() {
  _locationUpdateTimer?.cancel();
  _locationUpdateTimer = null;

  _locationSubscription?.cancel();
  _locationSubscription = null;

  _currentRoute = null;
  _lastKnownPosition = null;

  if (!_navigationUpdateController.isClosed) {
    _navigationUpdateController.close();
  }
  if (!_locationUpdateController.isClosed) {
    _locationUpdateController.close();
  }
}
```

### 4. App Lifecycle Management (`enhanced_art_walk_experience_screen.dart`)

- Added `WidgetsBindingObserver` to handle app lifecycle changes
- Pause navigation when app goes to background
- Resume navigation when app returns to foreground
- Stop navigation when app is being closed

### 5. Location Permission Optimization (`Info.plist`)

**Before:**

```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
```

**After:**

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<!-- Removed "Always" location permissions -->
```

### 6. Timeout Protection (`art_walk_service.dart`)

- Added 30-second timeout for art walk completion process
- Added 10-second timeouts for XP awards and achievement updates
- Used batch writes for better performance and atomicity
- Graceful handling of timeout exceptions

**Example:**

```dart
return await (() async {
  // ... completion logic
})().timeout(const Duration(seconds: 30));
```

### 7. Enhanced Error Messages and User Feedback

- Better location permission error messages
- User-friendly notifications for navigation state changes
- Proper error handling with mounted widget checks

## Expected Results

1. **Reduced Battery Drain**: Medium accuracy location tracking with 10-meter distance filter
2. **No Background Crashes**: Proper app lifecycle management prevents background location issues
3. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper disposal of streams, timers, and controllers
4. **Timeout Protection**: Operations won't hang indefinitely
5. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages and state feedback

## Testing

Created `art_walk_crash_fix_test.dart` to verify:

- Navigation service disposes properly without crashes
- Multiple dispose calls don't cause issues
- Timeout mechanisms work correctly

## Deployment Notes

1. **iOS**: Removed "Always" location permissions - app now only requests "When In Use"
2. **Android**: Existing permissions are sufficient
3. **Testing**: Test on devices with poor network connectivity to verify timeout handling
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor crash reports to confirm fix effectiveness

## Files Modified

1. `lib/src/services/art_walk_navigation_service.dart` - Location tracking optimization
2. `lib/src/screens/enhanced_art_walk_experience_screen.dart` - App lifecycle management
3. `lib/src/services/art_walk_service.dart` - Timeout protection
4. `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Location permission optimization
5. `test/art_walk_crash_fix_test.dart` - New test file

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- Crash rates during art walk completion
- Battery usage during navigation
- User feedback on navigation reliability
- Firebase performance metrics for art walk completion times
