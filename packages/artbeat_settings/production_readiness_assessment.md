## Final Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION**

The artbeat_settings module is not ready for production deployment and poses significant risks to user experience, security, and legal compliance. While the underlying architecture is solid, the lack of functional user interfaces and critical security features makes this module unsuitable for any production environment.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Requirements**:

1. Functional settings screens with full CRUD operations
2. Password change and basic security features
3. Input validation and error handling
4. Data deletion capability for compliance
5. Basic accessibility features

**Estimated Time to Production Readiness**: 4-6 weeks with dedicated development resources

**Alternative Recommendation**:
Consider launching with a simplified settings screen that only provides access to existing functional areas (like artist onboarding) while implementing core settings functionality in the background.
