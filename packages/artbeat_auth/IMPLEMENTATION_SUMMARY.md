### 4. Route Management

- Added `emailVerification` route constant
- Added `getEmailVerificationRoute()` helper method
- Updated `isAuthRoute()` to include new routes

### 5. Testing

- Added comprehensive test cases for new screens
- Updated existing tests to work with new authentication flow
- Fixed test compatibility issues with ArtbeatButton usage

### 6. Documentation

- Updated README with complete feature documentation
- Added detailed screen descriptions and usage examples
- Updated package dependencies and relationships
- Documented new authentication flow steps

## Technical Implementation Details

### Email Verification Flow

1. User registers or logs in
2. If email verification is required, redirect to verification screen
3. Screen automatically polls Firebase for verification status
4. User can resend verification email (with cooldown)
5. Upon verification, automatically redirect to dashboard
6. Skip option available for non-critical flows

### Profile Creation Flow

1. User completes authentication
2. System checks if profile exists in Firestore
3. If no profile, redirect to profile creation screen
4. Screen delegates to comprehensive profile creation from `artbeat_profile`
5. Upon completion, redirect to dashboard

### Dependencies Added

- `artbeat_profile` package for comprehensive profile creation
- Enhanced Firebase Auth integration for email verification

## Code Quality

- ✅ All code passes Flutter analysis with no warnings
- ✅ Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Modern UI/UX design patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Test coverage for new functionality

## Integration Points

- Seamlessly integrates with existing `artbeat_core` components
- Uses `artbeat_profile` for comprehensive profile creation
- Maintains compatibility with existing authentication flows
- Follows established routing and navigation patterns

## Next Steps

The authentication module is now complete with:

- Full registration → email verification → profile creation → dashboard flow
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Modern, responsive UI design
- Complete test coverage
- Thorough documentation

The module is ready for integration into the main ARTbeat application.
