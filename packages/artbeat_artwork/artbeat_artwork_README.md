### Integration Points

#### With Other Packages

- ✅ **artbeat_core** - Uses core models, services, and utilities
- ✅ **artbeat_artist** - Artist profile integration, subscription services
- ⚠️ **artbeat_community** - Social features (likes exist, comments missing)
- ⚠️ **artbeat_profile** - User profile integration
- 📋 **artbeat_admin** - Missing moderation UI integration

#### Identified Redundancies

**MyArtworkScreen in artbeat_artist**: ✅ **RESOLVED** (September 2025)

**Analysis**: The `MyArtworkScreen` in `artbeat_artist` (476 lines) duplicates core artwork management functionality already available in `artbeat_artwork` package.

**Redundant Functionality**:

- Artist artwork listing with grid layout
- Artwork card display with image/title/price
- Edit/Delete artwork actions
- Upload navigation
- Uses same `ArtworkService.getArtworkByArtistProfileId()` method
- Similar UI patterns for artwork management

**Resolution Strategy**:

- **Consolidate**: Move `MyArtworkScreen` functionality into `artbeat_artwork` as `ArtistArtworkManagementScreen`
- **Artist-Specific Features**: Keep subscription validation and artist profile integration in `artbeat_artist`
- **Shared Components**: Create reusable artwork grid widgets in `artbeat_artwork`
- **Clear Separation**:
  - `artbeat_artwork`: Core artwork CRUD operations, UI components, discovery
  - `artbeat_artist`: Artist profiles, subscriptions, business logic

**Implementation Plan**:

1. Create `ArtistArtworkManagementScreen` in `artbeat_artwork` package
2. Extract reusable `ArtworkGridWidget` for consistent artwork display
3. Update `artbeat_artist` to use shared components from `artbeat_artwork`
4. Remove duplicate `MyArtworkScreen` from `artbeat_artist`
5. Update routing to use consolidated screen

**Benefits**:

- Eliminates 476 lines of duplicate code
- Consistent artwork management UI across the app
- Better maintainability and testing
- Single source of truth for artwork operations
