# Zone-Based Ad System Migration - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

Successfully completed the migration from location-based ads (9 locations) to zone-based ads (5 strategic zones). All ad placements throughout the app have been updated to use the new `ZoneAdPlacementWidget`.

## Migration Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. **Core Infrastructure Created**

- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with legacy location-based ads

#### 2. **Ad Placements Migrated** (11 Total)

**Main Dashboard** (`artbeat_dashboard_screen.dart`)

- ✅ 6 placements updated from `RotatingAdPlacementWidget` → `ZoneAdPlacementWidget`
- Zone: `AdZone.homeDiscovery` ($25/day)
- Ad indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (for rotation variety)

**Community Hub** (`unified_community_hub.dart`)

- ✅ 1 placement updated from `BannerAdWidget` → `ZoneAdPlacementWidget`
- Zone: `AdZone.communitySocial` ($20/day)

**Events Dashboard** (`events_dashboard_screen.dart`)

- Zone: `AdZone.events` ($15/day)

**Capture Dashboard** (`enhanced_capture_dashboard_screen.dart`)

- ✅ 4 placements updated from `BannerAdWidget` → `ZoneAdPlacementWidget`
- Zone: `AdZone.artWalks` ($15/day)
- Ad indices: 0, 1, 2, 3 (for rotation variety)

**Example Files** (`simple_ad_example.dart`)

- ✅ Updated to demonstrate zone-based approach
- ✅ Added zone pricing information
- ✅ Removed unused imports

#### 3. **Zone Pricing Structure**

```
• Home & Discovery:      $25/day (Premium - highest traffic)
• Community & Social:    $20/day (High engagement)
• Art & Walks:           $15/day (Targeted art enthusiasts)
• Events & Experiences:  $15/day (Event-goers)
• Artist Profiles:       $10/day (Niche targeting)
```

#### 4. **Title Sponsorship**

- ✅ Confirmed pricing: **$5,000/month** (not $500-1,000)
- ✅ Exclusive placement (only one active sponsor at a time)
- ✅ Already integrated into splash screen and drawer

## Technical Details

### Widget Replacement Pattern

```dart
// OLD (Location-Based)
BannerAdWidget(
  location: AdLocation.fluidDashboard,
)

// NEW (Zone-Based)
ZoneAdPlacementWidget(
  zone: AdZone.homeDiscovery,
  showIfEmpty: true,
  adIndex: 0, // Optional: for rotation variety
)
```

### Zone Assignment Strategy

- **Dashboard/Browse screens** → `AdZone.homeDiscovery`
- **Art Walk/Capture screens** → `AdZone.artWalks`
- **Community/Messaging/Feeds** → `AdZone.communitySocial`
- **Event screens** → `AdZone.events`
- **Artist Profile pages** → `AdZone.artistProfiles`

### Key Features

1. **Ad Rotation**: Automatically rotates through multiple ads every 30 seconds
2. **Smart Placeholders**: Shows zone name, icon, and pricing when no ads available
3. **Indexed Placement**: Use `adIndex` parameter to show different ads in same zone
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy location-based ads automatically map to zones via `effectiveZone` getter
