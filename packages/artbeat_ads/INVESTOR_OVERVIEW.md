## Risk Mitigation

### Market Risk
**Risk**: Eastern NC is geographically small; limited advertiser universe  
**Mitigation**: 
- Tier-2 expansion planned for months 7–12 (15M+ additional population within 90 min drive)
- Geographic arbitrage: Low CAC in Eastern NC → high margins → fund expansion
- Product doesn't change; repeat playbook in new markets

### Competitive Risk
**Risk**: Facebook/Google could add local SMB products  
**Mitigation**:
- ArtBeat's moat is **community trust + native context**, not technology
- Faster decision-making than Big Tech
- First-mover advantage in arts/culture niche
- $200/month SMB budgets won't move to Facebook (minimum $5K/mo spend)

### Churn Risk
**Risk**: Advertisers try once, don't renew  
**Mitigation**:
- NPS monitoring; rapid feedback loops
- Proactive support (call/email if no ROI seen)
- Performance dashboard showing impressions/clicks
- Seasonal bundling (Q4 holiday packages, event season discounts)

### Regulatory Risk
**Risk**: Data privacy (GDPR, CCPA), payment compliance  
**Mitigation**:
- Built on Firebase (HIPAA, SOC2 compliant)
- Payment processing via Stripe (PCI-DSS certified)
- Privacy policy aligned with Apple/Google guidelines
- Audit trail for ad impressions/clicks

### Unit Economics Risk
**Risk**: Acquisition cost rises as market saturates  
**Mitigation**:
- Organic + partnership channels keep CAC flat
- LTV improves with retention (target 55–65%)
- Upsell (Small→Big) increases ARPU by 40–50%
- Expansion revenue (new markets) dilutes CAC impact
