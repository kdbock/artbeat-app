# Legacy Component Removal Checklist

This checklist ensures safe removal of legacy components and successful migration to the simplified ad system.

## üöÄ Pre-Removal Steps

- [ ] **Backup current system**

  - [ ] Create git branch: `git checkout -b remove-legacy-ads`
  - [ ] Commit current state: `git add . && git commit -m "Pre-removal backup"`

- [ ] **Verify simplified system works**

  - [ ] Test `SimpleAdCreateScreen`
  - [ ] Test `SimpleAdManagementScreen`
  - [ ] Test `BannerAdWidget` placement
  - [ ] Test `FeedAdWidget` integration
  - [ ] Test `SimpleAdService` functionality

- [ ] **Document current integrations**
  - [ ] List all screens using legacy ad widgets
  - [ ] Note any custom modifications to legacy components
  - [ ] Identify external dependencies on legacy models

## üóëÔ∏è Removal Process

### Phase 1: Run Removal Scripts

- [ ] **Execute master cleanup script**

  ```bash
  cd packages/artbeat_ads
  ./scripts/cleanup_legacy_system.sh
  ```

- [ ] **Verify script completion**
  - [ ] Check backup directory was created
  - [ ] Confirm legacy files are removed
  - [ ] Verify exports are updated
  - [ ] Ensure no compilation errors

### Phase 2: Manual Cleanup

- [ ] **Check for remaining references**

  - [ ] Search codebase for legacy imports: `grep -r "ArtistAdCreateScreen" .`
  - [ ] Search for legacy service usage: `grep -r "AdBusinessService" .`
  - [ ] Search for legacy model usage: `grep -r "AdArtistModel" .`

- [ ] **Update any remaining references**

  - [ ] Replace legacy screen navigations
  - [ ] Update service instantiations
  - [ ] Convert legacy model usage

- [ ] **Clean up pubspec.yaml**
  - [ ] Remove unused dependencies
  - [ ] Update version constraints if needed
  - [ ] Run `flutter pub get`

## ‚úÖ Post-Removal Validation

### Code Quality Checks

- [ ] **Static analysis passes**

  ```bash
  flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos
  ```

- [ ] **No compilation errors**

  ```bash
  flutter pub get
  dart compile exe lib/artbeat_ads.dart
  ```

- [ ] **Import statements are clean**
  - [ ] No imports of removed files

## üìä Success Metrics

### Codebase Reduction

- [ ] **File count reduced by ~60-70%**

  - Before: ~50+ files
  - After: ~15-20 files

- [ ] **Lines of code reduced significantly**
  - Removed complex form logic
  - Removed user-type specific code
  - Removed legacy service layers

### Simplified Architecture

- [ ] **Single ad creation screen** (vs 3+ legacy screens)
- [ ] **Single admin screen** (vs multiple review screens)
- [ ] **Single service** (vs 8+ legacy services)
- [ ] **Unified model** (vs user-type specific models)

### Improved Developer Experience

- [ ] **Easier integration** - simple widget placement
- [ ] **Better documentation** - comprehensive guides
- [ ] **Working examples** - copy-paste ready code
- [ ] **Consistent API** - no user-type complexity

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues are discovered after removal:

- [ ] **Immediate rollback**

  ```bash
  # Restore from backup
  cp -r legacy_backup_*/* .
  git checkout -- .
  flutter pub get
  ```

- [ ] **Partial rollback**

  - [ ] Restore specific files from backup
  - [ ] Re-add to exports if needed
  - [ ] Test integration

- [ ] **Fix and retry**
  - [ ] Identify and fix issues
  - [ ] Re-run removal scripts
  - [ ] Validate again
