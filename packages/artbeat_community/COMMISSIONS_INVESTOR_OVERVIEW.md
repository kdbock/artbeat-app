# ArtBeat Direct Commissions
## Investor Information Sheet

**Document Date**: November 2025  
**Company**: ArtBeat  
**Product**: Direct Commissions Feature (Artist-to-Client Custom Artwork Monetization)  
**Launch Market**: Eastern North Carolina  
**Founder Model**: Solo founder + part-time friend support  

---

## Executive Summary

ArtBeat Direct Commissions is a **marketplace monetization layer** enabling artists and collectors to negotiate and execute custom artwork commissions directly on the platform. It creates a B2B2C revenue stream where ArtBeat takes a platform commission on each transaction while artists set their own pricing and terms—building a sustainable ecosystem for custom creative work.

**The Opportunity:**
- **Revenue Stream**: High-value transactions (avg. $200–$800 per commission); platform commission 15% per transaction
- **Year 1 Target Revenue**: $50K–$150K (50–300 commissions @ $200–$500 avg; 15% platform take)
- **Unit Economics**: 15% platform margin on all commission transactions; 85% flows to artist (after payment processor fees)
- **Growth Driver**: Unique value prop vs. Fiverr/Upwork; community-driven artist discovery; high lifetime value
- **Minimal Development Cost**: Core infrastructure built; scalable at low marginal cost

This is the **highest-value revenue stream** per transaction, complementing subscriptions (recurring; predictable) and gifts (impulse; low friction). Commissions drive artist monetization while building platform stickiness through multi-month project engagement.

## Market Context & Opportunity

### The Custom Artwork Problem

Collectors face three critical challenges:
1. **Discovery**: Hard to find artists who do custom work; most rely on word-of-mouth or global marketplaces
2. **Trust**: No clear process for negotiation, milestone payments, dispute resolution
3. **Local Connection**: Existing platforms (Fiverr, Upwork) are anonymous; no community context

Artists face reciprocal challenges:
1. **Price Control**: Global platforms enforce pricing; undercut by low-wage workers
2. **Quality Expectations**: Mismatched specs lead to revisions, disputes, low profitability
3. **Payment Risk**: Client doesn't pay until "happy"—no deposit protection

### Existing Solutions & Gaps

| Platform | Custom Work Model | Commission Fee | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| **Fiverr** | Gig marketplace | 20% | Global reach; escrow | Races to bottom on price; no community |
| **Upwork** | Freelance bidding | 20–30% | Professional clients | Highly competitive; global friction |
| **Local Studios** | In-person or email | None | Personal; trusted | Hard to scale; limited reach |
| **Instagram DMs** | Informal negotiation | None | Direct artist contact | No dispute resolution; chaotic |
| **ArtBeat Commissions** | **Community discovery; artist-led pricing; milestone-based** | **15%** | **Local trust; artist control; integrated; escrow** |

### Why Now (Eastern NC Context)

1. **Post-Pandemic Custom Demand**: Collectors want unique, bespoke work; willing to pay premium for local/community artists
2. **Artist Pricing Power**: Shortage of custom artists in region (vs. global oversupply on Fiverr); artists can charge fair rates
3. **Community Trust**: ArtBeat's existing artist network = built-in discovery; no cold-start problem
4. **Payment Infrastructure**: IAP + Stripe backend already deployed; escrow/milestone support lower risk
5. **Tourism & Decor**: Local businesses, wedding planners, event organizers seek bespoke artist work

### Addressable Market

**Primary (Year 1):**
- **Active Artists** (accepting commissions): 50–150 in Eastern NC (subset of 1,500–3,000 total)
- **Collectors/Clients**: 100–300 repeat buyers in region
- **Average Commission Value**: $200–$500 (custom work, local artist premium)

**Conservative (Year 1):** 
- 30–50 completed commissions; $200–$400 avg; $6K–$20K platform revenue

**Realistic (Year 1):**
- 100–150 completed commissions; $300–$500 avg; $45K–$112K platform revenue

**Growth (Year 2+):**
- 250–400 commissions annually; $400–$800 avg; $150K–$480K platform revenue (with regional expansion)

## Financial Model

### Revenue Split & Economics

**Gross Commission Value (per $500 commission):**
```
$500 (client pays via Stripe/IAP)
  ├─ $15 (payment processing, Stripe 2.9% + $0.30)
  ├─ $85 (ArtBeat platform fee, 15%)
  └─ $400 (artist net, after fees)
```

**Platform Economics:**
- **Commission Fee**: 15% (lower than Fiverr/Upwork 20–30%; higher than local direct; competitive vs. regional alternatives)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe handles escrow; 2.9% + $0.30/transaction
- **Net Platform Margin**: 15% of transaction value (after payment processor fees, platform cost negligible at scale)

## Strategic Value

### Why This Matters (Beyond Direct Revenue)

1. **High Engagement & LTV**
   - Commission projects span 2–8 weeks; sustained platform interaction
   - Clients who commission show highest lifetime value (vs. gift-only, subscription-only users)
   - 60–75% of commission clients become repeat customers or upgrade to artist subscriptions

2. **Artist Revenue Diversification**
   - Subscriptions = predictable; Commissions = one-time high-value
   - Artists can sustain on 10–20 commissions/year + subscription income
   - Reduces reliance on single revenue model

3. **Network Lock-in**
   - Commissions tie artists to platform (client history, ratings, escrow protection)
   - Clients return to platform for repeat artists
   - Reduces churn for both parties

4. **Community Authenticity**
   - Custom work = premium value; hard for competitors to replicate
   - Positions ArtBeat as creator platform, not just social app
   - Artist profiles become portfolio showcases (major SEO/discovery opportunity)

5. **Data & Insights**
   - Commission specs reveal which styles, types, sizes, budgets are in demand
   - Feeds recommendation algorithm for subscriptions, partnerships, featured artists
   - Analytics: turnaround times, revision patterns, pricing elasticity

### LTV & Monetization Stacking

**Per-Artist Annual Revenue (Realistic Scenario):**
```
Subscriptions:  $30–$100/month → $360–$1,200/year
Gifts:          50–100 gifts/year @ $9.99 avg → $250–$500/year (artist receives 70%)
Commissions:    5–10 commissions/year @ $400 avg → $1,700–$3,400/year (artist receives 85%)

Total Artist LTV: $2,300–$5,100/year
Platform Revenue (subscriptions 70% margin + gifts 30% margin + commissions 15%):
  - Subscriptions: $84–$420/year
  - Gifts: $75–$150/year
  - Commissions: $255–$510/year
  = Total Platform Revenue: $414–$1,080/year per artist
```

**Per-Collector Annual Spending (Realistic):**
```
Gifts sent:     10–20 gifts/year @ $9.99 avg → $100–$200/year
Commissions:    1–3 commissions/year @ $350 avg → $350–$1,050/year

Total Collector Spend: $450–$1,250/year
Platform Revenue: $52.50–$187.50/year per collector (15% of commissions + some gift fees)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Adoption Risk (Artists)
**Risk**: Artists don't list commissions; feature remains inactive  
**Mitigation**:
- Founder-led outreach: Direct calls + free setup support
- Incentives: Waive platform fee for first 3 commissions
- Social proof: Early artist testimonials in app
- Partner channels: Arts councils, studio collectives

### Adoption Risk (Collectors)
**Risk**: Users don't know how to commission; low discovery  
**Mitigation**:
- In-app onboarding: "Request a custom commission" tutorial
- Featured artists: Homepage showcases top commissioners
- Email campaigns: Highlight specific artists, recent work
- Community feed integration: Visible commission requests/completions

### Monetization Risk
**Risk**: Platform fee cannibalizes direct artist-client deals  
**Mitigation**:
- 15% fee is competitive vs. Fiverr (20–30%); justifies platform value
- Escrow/dispute protection worth 15% fee to both parties
- Terms of service: Encourage repeat clients to return to platform
- Data: Track if commission feature cannibalizes subscriptions (should not; different value prop)

### Payment/Dispute Risk
**Risk**: Payment failures, chargebacks, quality disputes, escrow refund cycles  
**Mitigation**:
- Stripe escrow: Platform holds funds until delivery + approval
- Milestone payments: Split payments reduce single-point-of-failure risk
- Clear specs: Commission templates + checklist reduce mismatches
- Dispute resolution: Platform mediation before refund
- Insurance: Explore fraud/chargeback insurance as volume scales

### Competitive Risk
**Risk**: Established platforms (Fiverr, Upwork) enter local market  
**Mitigation**:
- Network advantage: Community trust + artist relationships are defensible
- High-touch service: Solo founder personalization beats global algorithms
- Pricing: 15% fee beats 20–30% even if Fiverr goes regional
- Vertical integration: Subscriptions + gifts + commissions = unique stack
- Geographic focus: Deep roots in Eastern NC before national players care

### Fraud/Quality Risk
**Risk**: Artists don't deliver; collectors don't pay; disputes erode trust  
**Mitigation**:
- Deposit requirement: 30–50% upfront protects artist
- Milestone releases: Final payment only at acceptance
- Ratings/reviews: Public accountability
- Artist verification: Studio photos, portfolio review, community checks
- Collector screening: Detailed briefs; clear expectations upfront
- Arbitration: Clear terms; escalation process
