# Package Responsibility Matrix

## Phase 2 Integration Improvements - Clear Responsibilities

This document clarifies the responsibilities between `artbeat_core` and `artbeat_artist` packages to resolve conflicts and improve integration.

## üì¶ Package Responsibilities

### `artbeat_core` Package

**Primary Role**: Foundation services and shared functionality

#### Responsibilities:

- ‚úÖ **Basic User Management** - UserModel, UserService
- ‚úÖ **Basic Subscription Plans** - SubscriptionTier, SubscriptionService
- ‚úÖ **Artist Discovery** - Enhanced ArtistService with search and profiles
- ‚úÖ **Payment Processing** - Stripe integration, PaymentService
- ‚úÖ **Authentication** - Firebase Auth integration
- ‚úÖ **Storage & Media** - File uploads, image optimization
- ‚úÖ **Theme & UI Components** - Shared design system

#### Models:

- `UserModel` - Core user data
- `ArtistProfileModel` - **Primary artist profile model**
- `SubscriptionModel` - Core subscription data
- `SubscriptionTier` - Subscription tier definitions

#### Services:

- `ArtistService` - **Primary artist service** (enhanced with search)
- `UserService` - User management
- `SubscriptionService` - Basic subscription management
- `PaymentService` - Payment processing

- `EventModel` - Artist events and exhibitions
- `SubscriptionModel` - **Artist-specific subscription data** (extends core)

#### Services:

- `AnalyticsService` - Artist-specific analytics
- `EarningsService` - Artist financial management
- `SubscriptionService` - **Artist-enhanced subscription features**
- `GalleryInvitationService` - Gallery management
- `EventService` - Artist event management
- `IntegrationService` - **Cross-package data unification**

## üîÑ Integration Strategy

### Resolved Conflicts:

#### 1. ‚úÖ ArtistService Consolidation

**Problem**: Duplicate ArtistService implementations
**Solution**:

- `artbeat_core.ArtistService` ‚Üí **Primary service** (enhanced with search)
- `artbeat_artist.ArtistService` ‚Üí **Deprecated** (migration guide provided)

#### 2. ‚úÖ ArtistProfileModel Usage

**Problem**: Two different ArtistProfileModel implementations
**Solution**:

- `artbeat_core.ArtistProfileModel` ‚Üí **Primary model** (comprehensive)
- `artbeat_artist.ArtistProfileModel` ‚Üí **Hidden from exports** (internal use only)

#### 3. ‚úÖ Subscription Responsibilities

**Problem**: Overlapping subscription functionality
**Solution**:

- `artbeat_core.SubscriptionService` ‚Üí **Basic subscription management**
- `artbeat_artist.SubscriptionService` ‚Üí **Artist-enhanced features**
- `IntegrationService` ‚Üí **Unified subscription capabilities**

#### 4. ‚úÖ Cross-Package Communication

**Problem**: Difficult to coordinate between packages
**Solution**:

- `IntegrationService` ‚Üí **Single point for cross-package operations**
- `UnifiedArtistData` ‚Üí **Combined data from both packages**
- `SubscriptionCapabilities` ‚Üí **Unified feature access logic**

## üìã Migration Guide

### For ArtistService Usage:

```dart
// OLD (artbeat_artist) - DEPRECATED
import 'package:artbeat_artist/artbeat_artist.dart' as artist;
final service = artist.ArtistService();
final artists = await service.getFeaturedArtists();

// NEW (artbeat_core) - RECOMMENDED
import 'package:artbeat_core/artbeat_core.dart';
final service = ArtistService();
final artists = await service.getFeaturedArtistProfiles(); // Enhanced with search
```

### For Cross-Package Operations:

```dart
// NEW - Unified Integration
import 'package:artbeat_artist/artbeat_artist.dart';

final integration = IntegrationService.instance;
final unifiedData = await integration.getUnifiedArtistData(userId);
final capabilities = await integration.getSubscriptionCapabilities(userId);

if (capabilities.canAccessAnalytics) {
  // User has analytics access from either package
}
```

### For Subscription Management:

```dart
// Core subscription (basic plans)
final coreService = SubscriptionService(); // from artbeat_core
final basicSub = await coreService.getUserSubscription();

// Artist subscription (enhanced features)
final artistService = artist.SubscriptionService(); // from artbeat_artist
final artistSub = await artistService.getCurrentSubscription(userId);

// Unified approach (recommended)
final integration = IntegrationService.instance;
final capabilities = await integration.getSubscriptionCapabilities(userId);
```
