## 🚧 REMAINING WORK - FINAL CLEANUP

### 1. Service Conversions (14 files remaining) ⚠️

**Pattern to Apply**:

```dart
// Replace this pattern:
try {
  debugPrint('Starting operation...');
  // operation
  debugPrint('Operation completed');
} catch (e) {
  debugPrint('Error: $e');
  rethrow;
}

// With this pattern:
await ErrorMonitoringService.safeExecute(
  'ServiceName.methodName',
  () async {
    ArtistLogger.info('Starting operation');
    // operation
    ArtistLogger.info('Operation completed');
  },
  context: {'param': value},
);
```

### Priority Service Files (High Impact):

```
🚨 CRITICAL (Payment & Core):
├── lib/src/services/subscription_service.dart (debugPrint statements)
├── lib/src/services/event_service.dart (debugPrint statements)
├── lib/src/services/user_service.dart (debugPrint statements)

⚠️  HIGH (Business Logic):
├── lib/src/services/offline_data_provider.dart (debugPrint statements)
├── lib/src/services/integration_service.dart (debugPrint statements)
├── lib/src/services/subscription_validation_service.dart (debugPrint statements)
├── lib/src/services/filter_service.dart (debugPrint statements)
├── lib/src/services/artwork_service.dart (debugPrint statements)
├── lib/src/services/subscription_plan_validator.dart (debugPrint statements)

📱 MEDIUM (UI Components):
