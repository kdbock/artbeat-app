## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Wizard vs Settings Page**

✅ Chose wizard because:

- Step-by-step guidance reduces anxiety

- Validation at each step
- 4 minutes vs 20+ minutes

### 2. **Horizontal Carousel**

✅ Chosen for commission artists because:

- Prominent placement at top of artists tab
- Quick scanning of options
- Doesn't clutter full artist list
- Easy to see featured artists

### 3. **Type-Based Filtering**

✅ Because:

- Artists have specific specialties
- Clients looking for specific art types
- More precise than text search
- Fast filter interaction

```

CommissionBadge           // Profile display
CommissionInfoCard        // Pricing info
CommissionArtistsBrowser  // Discovery
CommissionFilterDialog    // Filtering
CommissionSetupWizard     // Onboarding
```

### State Management (Simple)
