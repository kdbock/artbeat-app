## 📊 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1 Completion (Today's Work)

We systematically went through the entire capture system checklist and:

1. ✅ **Analyzed** the complete capture package structure
2. ✅ **Identified** 22 capture system features with detailed status for each
3. ✅ **Fixed** capture detail routing (was returning "not found")
4. ✅ **Created** CaptureDetailViewerScreen (400+ lines of production code)
5. ✅ **Updated** navigation in CapturesListScreen
6. ✅ **Verified** MyCapturesScreen already had correct navigation
7. ✅ **Fixed** package exports to include all screens
8. ✅ **Created** comprehensive documentation and implementation plans

### Current Capture Feature Status

```

## 🚀 Phase 1 Technical Details

### New File Created

**CaptureDetailViewerScreen.dart** - 430 lines

This screen provides:

- Fetch capture from Firestore by ID
- Display complete capture metadata
- Edit button (owner only)
- Delete button (owner only) with confirmation dialog
- Share button with system share dialog
- Responsive error handling
- Loading states
- Proper null safety and lifecycle management

### Routing Changes

**app_router.dart** - Updated capture detail route

```dart
case AppRoutes.captureDetail:
  final captureId = RouteUtils.getArgument<String>(settings, 'captureId');
  if (captureId == null || captureId.isEmpty) {
    return RouteUtils.createErrorRoute('Capture ID is required');
  }
  return RouteUtils.createMainLayoutRoute(
    child: capture.CaptureDetailViewerScreen(captureId: captureId),
  );
```

### Export Updates

- Added 5 new exports to screens.dart
- Added CaptureDetailViewerScreen to artbeat_capture.dart

### Navigation Flow

```
My Captures / Browse Captures
    ↓ (tap on item)
Navigator.pushNamed('/capture/detail', args: {captureId})
    ↓
CaptureDetailViewerScreen loads
    ↓
Fetches from Firestore using CaptureService.getCaptureById()
    ↓
Displays full capture details with actions
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Improvements

1. **Comments** - No nested replies (could add in future)
2. **Likes** - No like list view (can add in future)
3. **Map** - Not clustered for many markers (can optimize)
4. **Gallery** - No infinite scroll pagination (can add if needed)
5. **Offline** - Likes/comments not queued offline (lower priority)
