## Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues

🔴 **None identified** - All core artwork features are implemented

### High Priority Improvements

1. **Implement Featured/Recent/Trending Screens**

   - Create dedicated screens instead of "Coming Soon" placeholders
   - Routes already exist: `/artwork/featured`, `/artwork/recent`, `/artwork/trending`
   - Suggested: Use filtered ArtworkBrowseScreen or ArtworkDiscoveryScreen

2. **Implement Search Route**

   - `/artwork/search` currently shows placeholder
   - Should search artwork by title, description, tags, styles

3. **Complete Purchase Flow**
   - Current: Placeholder button shows "Coming Soon"
   - Needed: Full payment processing integration
   - Consider: Stripe, PayPal, or in-app purchase integration

### Medium Priority Improvements

1. **Social Media Sharing**

   - Stories, Facebook, Instagram sharing currently show "coming soon"
   - Implement integration with social SDKs

2. **Artwork Analytics**

   - Add dedicated analytics screen for artists
   - Track performance metrics over time

3. **Recommendation Algorithm Refinement**
   - Personalization could be enhanced
   - Consider user interaction history more deeply

### Low Priority Improvements

1. **Artwork Collections**

   - Allow users to create custom collections
   - Share collections with others

2. **AR Preview**
