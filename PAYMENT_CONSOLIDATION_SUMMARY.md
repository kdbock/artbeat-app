# Payment Service Consolidation Summary

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Purpose**: Eliminate redundant payment processing and consolidate 5 revenue streams into single unified service

---

## Problem Statement

The app had **5+ redundant payment services** causing conflicts and breaking changes:

- `PaymentService` - core payment logic
- `EnhancedPaymentService` (working version) - enhanced with risk assessment
- `EnhancedPaymentService` (v2, final) - duplicates
- `PaymentStrategyService` - routing logic between IAP and Stripe
- `PaymentAnalyticsService` - in both core and ads packages

This redundancy created:

- Inconsistent payment processing
- Multiple instances of the same functionality
- Conflicts between services
- Difficult to maintain 5 revenue streams (subscriptions, gifts, ads, commissions, artwork)

---

## Solution: UnifiedPaymentService

### What Was Created

**File**: `packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/services/unified_payment_service.dart`

A single, consolidated payment service handling **all 5 revenue streams**:

#### 1. **Subscriptions** (Apple IAP + Stripe)

```dart
Future<SubscriptionResult> processSubscriptionPayment({
  required SubscriptionTier tier,
  required PaymentMethod method,
  String? paymentMethodId,
})
```

#### 2. **Gifts** (Apple IAP + Stripe)

```dart
Future<PaymentResult> processGiftPayment({
  required String recipientId,
  required double amount,
  required PaymentMethod method,
  String? paymentMethodId,
  String? giftMessage,
})
```

#### 3. **Ads** (Stripe only)

```dart
Future<PaymentResult> processAdPayment({
  required String adId,
  required double amount,
  required int durationDays,
  String? paymentMethodId,
})
```

#### 4. **Commissions** (Stripe only - Artist earnings)

```dart
Future<PaymentResult> processCommissionPayment({
  required String artworkId,
  required double amount,
  required String artistId,
  String? paymentMethodId,
})
```

#### 5. **Artwork Sales** (Stripe only)

```dart
Future<PaymentResult> processArtworkSalePayment({
  required String artworkId,
  required double amount,
  required String artistId,
  String? paymentMethodId,
})
```

### Core Features

✅ **Automatic Payment Method Routing** - Determines IAP vs Stripe based on module/purchase type
✅ **Risk Assessment & Fraud Detection** - Device fingerprinting, risk scoring
✅ **Customer Management** - Create customers, manage payment methods
✅ **Subscription Management** - Create, cancel, change subscription tiers
✅ **Refund Processing** - Request and process refunds
✅ **Revenue Analytics** - Track payments and metrics
✅ **Biometric Authentication Support** - Integrated security
✅ **Device Fingerprinting** - Fraud prevention

## Files Deleted (Redundant)

```
✅ enhanced_payment_service.dart (empty)
✅ enhanced_payment_service_final.dart (empty)
✅ enhanced_payment_service_v2.dart (empty)
```

---

## Files Kept (Legacy Compatibility)

```
⚠️ enhanced_payment_service_working.dart - deprecated, for backward compatibility
⚠️ payment_service.dart - deprecated, for backward compatibility
✅ payment_strategy_service.dart - still used by InAppPurchaseManager
✅ payment_analytics_service.dart - local to artbeat_ads package (separate)
```

## Files Updated

### Core Package (`artbeat_core`)

| File                                                   | Changes                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/artbeat_core.dart`                                | Export UnifiedPaymentService; keep old services for compatibility |
| `lib/src/services/services.dart`                       | Export unified_payment_service.dart                               |
| `lib/src/services/sponsorship_service.dart`            | Changed to use UnifiedPaymentService                              |
| `lib/src/screens/order_review_screen.dart`             | Changed to use UnifiedPaymentService                              |
| `lib/src/examples/biometric_payment_integration.dart`  | Updated to use UnifiedPaymentService                              |
| `lib/src/examples/enhanced_payment_usage_example.dart` | Updated to use UnifiedPaymentService                              |

### Community Package (`artbeat_community`)

| File                                                          | Status                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/screens/sponsorships/sponsor_tier_selection_dialog.dart` | Still imports EnhancedPaymentService (backward compatible) |
| `lib/screens/gifts/gift_modal.dart`                           | Still imports EnhancedPaymentService (backward compatible) |

## Migration Guide for Developers

### Old Code (Deprecated)

```dart
// Multiple services being instantiated separately
final paymentService = PaymentService();
final enhancedService = EnhancedPaymentService();
final strategyService = PaymentStrategyService();
final analyticsService = PaymentAnalyticsService();

// Had to manually handle routing
final method = strategyService.getPaymentMethod(purchaseType, module);
```

### New Code (Recommended)

```dart
// Single service for everything
final paymentService = UnifiedPaymentService();

// Built-in routing
final method = paymentService.getPaymentMethod(purchaseType, module);

// Easy revenue stream processing
await paymentService.processSubscriptionPayment(tier: tier, method: method);
await paymentService.processGiftPayment(recipientId: id, amount: amount, method: method);
await paymentService.processAdPayment(adId: id, amount: amount, durationDays: 30);
await paymentService.processCommissionPayment(artworkId: id, amount: amount, artistId: artistId);
await paymentService.processArtworkSalePayment(artworkId: id, amount: amount, artistId: artistId);
```

## Result Classes

All payment operations return well-defined result objects:

```dart
// Standard payment result
class PaymentResult {
  final bool success;
  final String? paymentIntentId;
  final String? error;
  final RiskAssessment? riskAssessment;
}

// Subscription-specific result
class SubscriptionResult {
  final bool success;
  final String? subscriptionId;
  final String? clientSecret;
  final String? error;
  final RiskAssessment? riskAssessment;
}

// Risk assessment for fraud detection
class RiskAssessment {
  final double riskScore; // 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high)
  final Map<String, dynamic> factors;
}
```

---

## Strategy Routing

The service automatically determines the correct payment method:

| Module               | Purchase Type  | Method                      |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Core**             | Subscription   | IAP (App Store requirement) |
| **Core**             | Consumable     | IAP (AI credits)            |
| **Core**             | Non-Consumable | IAP (Premium features)      |
| **Artist**           | Any            | Stripe (Need payouts)       |
| **Ads**              | Any            | Stripe (Apple forbids IAP)  |
| **Messaging**        | Consumable     | IAP (Digital perks)         |
| **Messaging**        | Non-Consumable | Stripe (Gift payouts)       |
| **Messaging**        | Subscription   | IAP                         |
| **Capture/ArtWalk**  | Any            | IAP                         |
| **Profile/Settings** | Any            | IAP                         |
