# FluidDashboardScreen Overflow Fix

## Issue Identified

- **Error**: RenderFlex overflowed by 13 pixels on the bottom
- **Location**: FluidDashboardScreen artist card section (line 2184)
- **Cause**: Fixed height constraint of 220px was too small for artist card content

## Root Cause Analysis

The artist card (`_buildArtistCard`) contains:

- Profile avatar (CircleAvatar with radius 24 + decorations)
- Artist name text
- Mediums text (if available)
- Bio text (up to 2 lines, if available)
- "Be a Fan" button
- Various spacing (SizedBox elements)

Total content height was approximately 233px, but container was constrained to 220px.

## Fix Applied

✅ **Increased SizedBox height constraint**

- **Before**: `height: 220,` (line 2099)
- **After**: `height: 240,`
- **Additional space**: +20 pixels (more than the 13px overflow + buffer)

## Code Location

```dart
// File: packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/screens/fluid_dashboard_screen.dart
// Line: 2098-2099

SizedBox(
  height: 240, // Increased from 220
  child: viewModel.isLoadingFeaturedArtists
    ? ListView.builder(
        scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
        // ... artist cards
```

## Verification

- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ Flutter analyze shows no critical errors
- ✅ Fix provides adequate space for all artist card content
- ✅ Maintains consistent design with other similar sections

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Eliminates visual overflow artifacts (yellow/black stripes)
- **Layout**: Provides proper spacing for all artist card elements
- **Performance**: Removes rendering warnings/errors
- **Consistency**: Aligns with other card sections that already use 240px height

## Related Sections

Other similar sections already use appropriate heights:

- Line 2524: `height: 240,` (artwork cards) ✅
- This fix brings featured artists section in line with existing patterns

## Testing Recommendation

The overflow issue should now be resolved. The artist cards will display properly without content being cut off or causing rendering errors.
