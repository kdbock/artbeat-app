# ARTbeat Flutter App â€” Copilot & Contributor Guide

## Overview
ARTbeat is a modular Flutter application for artists, galleries, and art lovers. It provides artist and gallery management, artwork discovery, social community, public art walks, and more. The codebase is organized into feature-based packages for maintainability, scalability, and parallel development.

## Modular Architecture
Each feature is a standalone Flutter package in `packages/`. All modules depend on `artbeat_core` for shared models, services, and utilities. Cross-dependencies are explicit in each module's `pubspec.yaml`.

- **artbeat_auth**: Authentication (login, registration, password recovery)
- **artbeat_profile**: User profiles, followers, favorites, achievements
- **artbeat_artist**: Artist & gallery dashboards, subscriptions, analytics, commissions
- **artbeat_artwork**: Artwork upload, management, browsing, moderation, sales
- **artbeat_art_walk**: Public art walks, Google Maps, location-based discovery, achievements
