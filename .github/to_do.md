With the understanding that firebase versions cannot be changed, I would like to create an in-app ad puchasing  package
User ads - users can promote their favorite artist, artwork, events and artwalks. Ad display options square or rectangle, specific industry standard size, Artists will create the approved ads for the user to pick from. User then chooses location of ad, length of time for the ad to run, the cost of all user ads are $1 a day. For $1 a day, you can help an artist keep creating. (or something like that) *Later implement - this will be part of how artists are sponsored. 
Artist ads - artists can promote their own events and artwork. The process is artist has a promote button, they select event or artwork, enter the details, ad duration, they also pay $1 a day. *future implementation. This will not count toward sponsored counts). Artists ads must be approved by admin, so they would get a screen that shows their pending ad and its status. 
admin ads - this option is only available to admins. Square and rectangle types, image upload once type is selected, loctions selected, add duration, these do not need approved but the full add should show on the next screen for review, they are just executed. 
Gallery ads - the same as artists ads, except gallaries / art instutitions/ places that qualify can promote their place of business with preapproved - presubmitted ads. Their ads also must be approved by admin. They cost $5 a day.
I want you to 
create a terminal command to create all the files needed to add artbeat_ads package and all the necessary folders and files needed to utilize all of the functions and features listed above.
execute that terminal command to create the files and folders
update the artbeat_ad pubspec.yaml with the same ones in the main app.
