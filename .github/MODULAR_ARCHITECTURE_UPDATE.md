# ARTbeat Modular Architecture Update

We have restructured the ARTbeat app into a modular architecture to improve maintainability, enable parallel development, and make the codebase more organized. This document provides an overview of the new architecture.

## Why Modular Architecture?

The ARTbeat app has grown substantially with many features, making it challenging to maintain as a monolithic application. Modularization offers several benefits:

- **Improved Code Organization**: Features are now grouped logically
- **Parallel Development**: Team members can work on different modules simultaneously
- **Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
- **Faster Build Times**: Only modified modules need to be recompiled
- **Better Dependency Management**: Clearer visibility of dependencies between features

## Module Structure

The app has been divided into the following modules:

### Core Module (`artbeat_core`)
Contains shared models, services, and utilities used across the app.

### Authentication Module (`artbeat_auth`)
Handles user authentication, registration, and password recovery.

### Profile Module (`artbeat_profile`)
Manages user profiles, followers, and favorites.

### Artist Module (`artbeat_artist`)
Provides artist-specific features including subscription management, gallery tools, and analytics.

### Artwork Module (`artbeat_artwork`)
Handles artwork uploading, browsing, and interaction.

### Art Walk Module (`artbeat_art_walk`)
Contains features for creating and browsing art walks and public art.

### Community Module (`artbeat_community`)
Manages social features like posts, comments, and the community feed.

### Settings Module (`artbeat_settings`)
Provides user settings and preferences management.

## How to Use the New Architecture

For detailed instructions on working with the modular architecture, please refer to:

- [Modularization Plan](MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md): The step-by-step migration plan
- [How to Use Modules](HOW_TO_USE_MODULES.md): A practical guide for working with modules
- [Modular Architecture](MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md): Technical overview of the architecture

## Current Status

The migration to a modular architecture is in progress:
- ‚úÖ Module structure created
- ‚úÖ Core module basic implementation
- üöß Sample artwork module migration
- üìù Next: Continue migration of all features

## Development Process

During the migration, we maintain dual versions of key files to ensure the app continues to function while we gradually move to the modular structure. Once migration is complete, the original files will be removed.

Please direct any questions about the new architecture to the development team.
