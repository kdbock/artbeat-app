// Manual Test Instructions for Art Community Hub Engagement Features
// ================================================================

/// TESTING LIKE FUNCTIONALITY:
/// 
/// 1. Open the ARTbeat app
/// 2. Navigate to Community Hub (bottom tab)
/// 3. Wait for posts to load
/// 4. Look for debug logs in terminal that show:
///    - "📱 Loading posts from community service..."
///    - "📱 Loaded X posts"
///    - "📱 First post like status: [true/false], like count: X"
/// 
/// 5. Tap on a heart (like) icon on any post
/// 6. Look for debug logs that show:
///    - "🤍 User attempting to like post: [post_id]"
///    - "🤍 Found post at index X"
///    - "🤍 Current like count: X, Currently liked: [true/false]"
///    - "🤍 Updated UI optimistically - new like count: X, new liked state: [true/false]"
///    - "🤍 Making API call to toggle like..."
///    - "🤍 ArtCommunityService.toggleLike called for postId: [post_id]"
///    - "🤍 Authenticated user: [user_uid]"
///    - "🤍 Like completed successfully" or "🤍 Unlike completed successfully"
///    - "🤍 API call result: [true/false]"
/// 
/// 7. Verify that:
///    - The heart icon changes from outline to filled (or vice versa)
///    - The like count increases/decreases by 1
///    - No error messages appear
/// 
/// TESTING COMMENT FUNCTIONALITY:
/// 
/// 1. Tap on a comment bubble icon on any post
/// 2. Look for debug logs that show:
///    - "💬 User attempting to open comments for post: [post_id]"
///    - "💬 Comments modal builder called"
///    - "💬 CommentsModal: Loading comments for post [post_id]"
///    - "💬 Getting comments for post: [post_id]"
///    - "💬 Retrieved X comments for post [post_id]"
///    - "💬 CommentsModal: Successfully loaded X comments"
/// 
/// 3. Verify that:
///    - A modal bottom sheet opens showing comments
///    - Comments load properly (or shows "No comments yet")
///    - You can type in the comment input field
///    - The modal can be dismissed by swiping down or tapping outside
/// 
/// TROUBLESHOOTING:
/// 
/// If likes don't work:
/// - Check if user is authenticated (look for 🔐 logs)
/// - Check if posts have valid IDs
/// - Check Firebase Firestore rules allow read/write access
/// 
/// If comments don't work:
/// - Check if the modal opens at all
/// - Check if comments collection exists in Firestore
/// - Check network connectivity
///
