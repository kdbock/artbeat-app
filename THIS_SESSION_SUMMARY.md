---

## 🔍 Clarification

The TODO.md file shows "12 in Phase 7 Art Walk - 100% COMPLETE!" which is **technically correct**, but:

- **8 TODOs** were completed in previous sessions
- **3 TODOs** were implemented in THIS session
- **1 TODO** was already done (just verified)

The navigation service integration was NOT done this session - it was already complete when we started.

---

## ✅ What's Actually Left

**Phase 7 is 100% complete!** All 12 TODOs are done.

The only remaining TODOs in the art_walk package are:

- Rating system (2 TODOs in progress_cards.dart - lines 646 & 785)
- Share on celebration screen (1 TODO in art_walk_celebration_screen.dart - line 583)

These are NOT part of the original Phase 7 plan.
