## 🎯 What You Need to Do Next

### **This Week (High Priority)**

1. **Add Your Google Maps API Key** ⏱️ 5 minutes

   ```bash
   nano .env.local
   # Replace: your_google_maps_api_key_here
   # With your actual key from Google Cloud Console
   ```

2. **Restrict Google Maps API Keys** ⏱️ 15 minutes

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Restrict each of the 4 keys found to your app's package/bundle ID
   - See `docs/NEXT_SECURITY_STEPS.md` for detailed steps

3. **Test Your Setup** ⏱️ 10 minutes

   ```bash
   # Verify security
   ./scripts/security_verify.sh

   # Test build with new config
   source .env.local
   ./scripts/build_secure.sh run
   ```

### **This Month (Medium Priority)**

4. **Regenerate OAuth Credentials**

   - Delete old OAuth client in Google Cloud Console
   - Create new credentials
   - Store only on backend (never in client)

5. **Audit Recent Activity**
   - Check Firebase Console for unusual activity
   - Check Stripe Dashboard for suspicious transactions

## 🎓 Key Lessons

1. **Never hardcode secrets** - Always use environment variables or secure configuration
2. **Rotate compromised keys immediately** - Even if you think they weren't exposed
3. **Use build-time injection** - `--dart-define` is your friend
4. **Automate security checks** - Scripts prevent future mistakes
5. **Document everything** - Future you will thank present you
