## Complete Conversation Summary

The conversation began with a Dart analyzer error indicating an ambiguous import conflict in the ARTbeat Flutter application. The error occurred in `/Users/kristybock/artbeat/packages/artbeat_artwork/lib/src/screens/artwork_detail_screen.dart` at line 29, where the `ArtworkModel` class was defined in two different packages: `artbeat_artwork` and `artbeat_core`, causing the Dart analyzer to be unable to determine which one to use.

I investigated the issue by examining both conflicting models to understand their differences and determine which one should be used. The `artbeat_artwork` package contained a comprehensive `ArtworkModel` with extensive fields including `userId`, `artistProfileId`, `isForSale`, `yearCreated`, `price`, and many others. In contrast, the `artbeat_core` package had a simpler `ArtworkModel` with fewer fields and used `artistId` instead of the more detailed user/artist profile structure.

By analyzing the code usage in the detail screen, I found that it was accessing fields like `isForSale`, `price`, `yearCreated`, `userId`, and `artistProfileId`, which were only available in the artbeat_artwork version. Additionally, the `ArtworkService.getArtworkById()` method was returning the artbeat_artwork version of the model, confirming that this was the correct one to use.

I also discovered a similar potential conflict with `ArtistProfileModel`, but found that the artbeat_artist package explicitly hides its own `ArtistProfileModel` to avoid conflicts with the core version, and the `artist.SubscriptionService.getArtistProfileById()` method returns the core version.

The solution was to modify the import statement for `artbeat_core` to hide the conflicting `ArtworkModel` class using the `hide` directive. I changed the import from `import 'package:artbeat_core/artbeat_core.dart';` to `import 'package:artbeat_core/artbeat_core.dart' hide ArtworkModel;`.

After implementing this fix, I verified the solution by running `flutter analyze` on the file, which confirmed that all issues were resolved. I then discovered and fixed the same ambiguous import issue in another file (`artwork_edit_screen.dart`) that had the identical problem. I also checked other related files and confirmed that `artwork_browse_screen.dart` was already properly structured to avoid conflicts.

The final outcome was the successful resolution of the ambiguous import errors, allowing the code to compile cleanly while ensuring that the correct, more comprehensive `ArtworkModel` from the artbeat_artwork package is used throughout the artwork detail and editing functionality.
