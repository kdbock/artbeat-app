## 🔌 Database Schema

### Engagements Collection

Used for both likes and comments:

```
engagements/ {
  {engagementId}: {
    contentId: "captureId",
    contentType: "capture",
    userId: "userId",
    type: "like" | "comment",

    // For comments only:
    text: "comment text",
    userName: "displayName",
    userAvatar: "photoUrl",
    likeCount: 5,
    likedBy: ["userId1", "userId2"],
    createdAt: Timestamp,
    updatedAt: Timestamp
  }
}
```

### Captures Collection Updates

Each capture document now maintains:

```
captures/ {
  {captureId}: {
    ...existing fields...,
    engagementStats: {
      likeCount: 42,
      commentCount: 8,
      ... other engagement counts
      lastUpdated: Timestamp
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Improvements

6. **Spam Detection**: No rate limiting on comments

### Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

- [ ] Comment editing functionality
- [ ] Nested replies/threading
- [ ] Rich text with @mentions
- [ ] Push notifications for likes/comments
- [ ] Comment spam filtering
- [ ] Block user's comments
- [ ] Sort comments (newest, most liked, etc.)
- [ ] Bookmark/save captures

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### 1. Code Push

```bash
cd /Users/kristybock/artbeat
flutter pub get  # Updates dependencies
flutter analyze  # Check for issues
```

### 2. Firebase Rules Update (if needed)

The current Firestore rules should allow:

- Any authenticated user to create engagements
- Users to delete their own engagements
- Public read access to engagements

### 3. Testing

```bash
flutter test  # Run unit tests if available
flutter run   # Run on device
```

### 4. Deployment

Push to your main branch for deployment.

## 🎓 Architecture Decisions

### Why This Approach?

1. **Engagement Collection**

   - Single collection for all engagement types
   - Allows future expansion (reviews, ratings, etc.)
   - Easier to query all engagement for a capture

2. **Like Button Widget**

   - Reusable across art walks, artwork, posts
   - Self-contained state management
   - No parent widget modifications needed

3. **Comments Section**

   - Single widget handles all comments
   - Integrated input form for UX
   - Real-time updates with FutureBuilder

4. **Edit Screen**
   - Separate screen for complex form
   - Pre-fills data for better UX
   - Dropdown selections prevent invalid data
