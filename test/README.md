# ArtBeat Tests

This directory contains tests for the main ArtBeat application.

## Current Status

Currently contains a minimal placeholder test to satisfy CI/CD requirements.

## Future Test Structure

As the application develops, consider organizing tests as follows:

```
test/
├── unit/              # Unit tests for individual functions/classes
├── widget/            # Widget tests for UI components
├── integration/       # Integration tests for feature flows
└── helpers/           # Test helpers and utilities
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run tests in watch mode
flutter test --watch
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding tests:

1. Follow the existing naming convention: `*_test.dart`
2. Group related tests using `group()`
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Mock external dependencies (Firebase, APIs, etc.)
5. Keep tests isolated and independent
