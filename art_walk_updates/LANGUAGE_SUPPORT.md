## Overview

## Changing Your Language

To change the language in ArtBeat:

1. Open the app and navigate to **Settings**
2. Select your preferred language from the **Language** section at the top
3. The app will immediately update to display content in your selected language
4. Your language preference is automatically saved and will persist when you reopen the app

## What's Localized

The following app components are available in all supported languages:

- **Authentication**: Sign in, sign up, password reset, and account recovery
- **Navigation**: Main navigation menus and section labels
- **User Interface**: All buttons, labels, and interactive elements
- **Messages**: Error messages, validation messages, and confirmations
- **Settings**: Preferences and account settings

## Regional Notes

### Google Maps
Google Maps automatically localizes based on your device language and location settings. Maps, place names, and directions will display in your selected language where available.

### Content Availability
Art listings, event descriptions, and community content may be in the original language provided by creators. User-generated content is typically not automatically translated.

## Technical Implementation

ArtBeat uses the `easy_localization` package for translation management. All translations are stored in JSON format and loaded dynamically when the app starts or when you change your language preference.

## Providing Feedback

If you encounter translation issues or have suggestions for improving localization, please contact our support team through the app's help section.

## Future Languages

We're continuously working to expand language support. If you'd like to see ArtBeat available in a language not currently listed, please let us know through the feedback feature in Settings.
