## üö® Potential Blockers

### High Risk

1. **Critical bugs found during testing**
   - Mitigation: Test early and thoroughly
2. **App rejected by stores**

   - Mitigation: Follow guidelines carefully, test compliance

3. **Privacy policy not ready**
   - Mitigation: Use templates, get legal review if needed

### Medium Risk

1. **Screenshots not compelling**

   - Mitigation: Get feedback, iterate on design

2. **Beta testers find major issues**

   - Mitigation: Allow time for fixes, don't rush

3. **Performance issues on older devices**
   - Mitigation: Test on various devices, optimize if needed

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Don't Rush:** Quality > Speed. Better to launch 1 week late than with critical bugs
2. **Get Feedback Early:** Show screenshots and listings to friends before submitting
3. **Test on Real Devices:** Emulators don't catch everything
4. **Monitor Closely:** Watch Crashlytics and Analytics during beta testing
5. **Prepare Support:** Have support email ready before launch
6. **Soft Launch:** Consider launching in one country first to test
7. **Update Regularly:** Plan for updates and bug fixes post-launch
