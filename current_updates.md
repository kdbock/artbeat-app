## Notes & Observations

1. **Many TODOs are placeholders** - Some might already be implemented but comments weren't removed
2. **Service integration pattern** - Many TODOs follow "implement actual service call" pattern
3. **Navigation TODOs** - Could be batch-completed by defining routes
4. **Analytics TODOs** - Many are "nice-to-have" rather than critical
5. **Moderation AI** - Low priority, can use basic moderation initially
6. **Payment infrastructure** - Extensive existing Stripe integration discovered (PaymentService, StripeService)
7. **Quick wins available** - ~10-15% of TODOs may already be implemented
8. **Session 2 pattern** - "Implement actual X" often means service already exists, just needs wiring
9. **Admin user tracking** - Important for audit trails in financial operations
10. **Graceful degradation** - Handle missing data (like paymentIntentId) elegantly
11. **Search implementation patterns** - Consistent StatefulBuilder dialogs, real-time filtering, tab-specific logic established
12. **Model property verification** - Need to verify model properties during implementation (e.g., ArtistProfile.location doesn't exist)
13. **Compilation error handling** - Flutter analyze essential for catching model property mismatches during development
