## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is adoption so low if the system is well-built?**
A: Feature visibility. If users don't know it exists, they can't use it. It's trapped in the drawer.

**Q: How long until we see ROI?**
A: Adoption should increase 2-3x within 1 month of visibility improvements. Revenue impact in 2-3 months.

**Q: Do we need to rebuild the system?**
A: No, foundation is solid. We need UI/UX improvements and integration work.

**Q: What's the biggest quick win?**
A: Adding commission badge + request button to artist profile. ~4 hours, huge impact.

**Q: Should we promote commissions heavily?**
A: Yes, but only after making the artist experience better. Otherwise will get negative feedback.
