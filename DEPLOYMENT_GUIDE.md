## ü§ñ Automated Deployment (CI/CD)

### Using GitHub Actions

#### Deploy to Staging

```bash
# Method 1: Push to develop branch
git checkout develop
git merge feature/your-feature
git push origin develop

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# 1. Run tests
# 2. Build Android & iOS
# 3. Upload to Firebase App Distribution
# 4. Deploy Firebase rules to staging
```

#### Deploy to Production

```bash
# Method 1: Push to main branch
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main

# Method 2: Create version tag
git tag v2.0.7
git push origin v2.0.7

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# 1. Run tests
# 2. Run security validation
# 3. Build Android & iOS
# 4. Upload to app stores
# 5. Deploy Firebase rules to production
# 6. Create GitHub release
```

#### Manual Trigger

You can also manually trigger workflows from GitHub:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select the workflow (e.g., "Deploy to Production")
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select branch and options
5. Click **Run workflow**

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### If Deployment Fails

#### Android

```bash
# 1. Stop the rollout in Google Play Console
# - Go to Release ‚Üí Production
# - Click "Halt rollout"

# 2. Revert to previous version
# - Click "Manage" on previous release
# - Click "Resume rollout" or "Increase rollout"

# 3. Fix the issue locally
git revert HEAD
# or
git checkout previous-working-commit

# 4. Redeploy
./scripts/build_android_release.sh production
```

#### iOS

```bash
# 1. Remove from review (if not yet approved)
# - Go to App Store Connect
# - Select your app
# - Click "Remove from Review"

# 2. If already live, submit previous version
# - You cannot rollback directly
# - Must submit a new build with fixes

# 3. Fix the issue locally
git revert HEAD

# 4. Redeploy
./scripts/build_ios_release.sh production
```

#### Firebase Rules

```bash
# 1. View deployment history
firebase deploy:history --project production

# 2. Rollback to previous version
firebase rollback firestore:rules --project production
firebase rollback storage:rules --project production

# Or specify a specific deployment ID
firebase rollback firestore:rules DEPLOYMENT_ID --project production
```

### Emergency Hotfix Process

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# 2. Fix the issue
# ... make changes ...

# 3. Test thoroughly
./scripts/run_tests.sh
./scripts/validate_production_ready.sh

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: Fix critical bug"
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# 5. Create PR to main
# - Get expedited review
# - Merge immediately after approval

# 6. Deploy
git checkout main
git pull
git push origin main  # Triggers CI/CD

# 7. Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
