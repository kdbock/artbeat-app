# Gift Screens Architecture Cleanup

## Date

Cleanup completed: 2025

## Problem Statement

The ArtBeat app had **6 gift-related screens** spread across two packages with overlapping/redundant functionality:

### Dead Code Identified

1. ❌ `gift_purchase_screen.dart` - Basic/legacy screen
2. ❌ `gift_subscription_screen.dart` - Unused screen (exported but never referenced)
3. ❌ `gift_campaign_screen.dart` - Unused screen (exported but never referenced)

### Active Screens (Kept)

1. ✅ `gift_modal.dart` (community package) - Quick selection modal for lightweight UX
2. ✅ `EnhancedGiftPurchaseScreen` (core package) - Full-featured screen with tabs, used by 3+ widgets
3. ✅ `gifts_screen.dart` (community package) - Hub for viewing available gifts
4. ✅ `gift_rules_screen.dart` (community package) - Rules/informational screen

## Architecture After Cleanup

### Two-Tier Gift System

#### 1. Modal (Quick Selection)

- **File:** `packages/artbeat_community/lib/screens/gifts/gift_modal.dart`
- **Package:** artbeat_community
- **Purpose:** Lightweight quick-select modal for sending gifts
- **Entry Points:** Community drawer, profile screens
- **Features:** Fast, minimal UI, four preset gift options

#### 2. Full Screen (Advanced Features)

- **File:** `packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/screens/enhanced_gift_purchase_screen.dart`
- **Package:** artbeat_core
- **Purpose:** Full-featured screen with preset, custom, and subscription tabs
- **Entry Points:** Content engagement widgets, artist public profiles
- **Features:** Tab-based navigation, custom amounts, subscriptions, artist profile info

#### 3. Gift Hub & Rules

- **Files:** `gifts_screen.dart`, `gift_rules_screen.dart`
- **Purpose:** Gift history and informational pages
- **Entry Points:** Community drawer menu

## Why This Architecture

### Problem with Previous Approach

- **GiftPurchaseScreen**: Basic but deprecated - no tabs, limited features
- **GiftSubscriptionScreen**: Orphaned - designed but never integrated
- **GiftCampaignScreen**: Orphaned - designed but never integrated
- Created confusion about which screen to use

### New Approach Benefits

1. **Clear Responsibility:** Modal = quick action, Full Screen = advanced features
2. **No Dead Code:** All exported screens are actively used
3. **Maintainability:** Fewer similar components to update
4. **User Experience:** Two UX patterns for different contexts:
   - Modal: Impulse gifts from artist profiles
   - Full Screen: Dedicated purchase experience with custom amounts

---

## Verification Checklist

✅ Dead screens removed
✅ Exports updated
✅ Example code updated
✅ No broken imports
✅ Architecture documented
✅ Gift modal still works (recently updated for App Store IAP)
✅ EnhancedGiftPurchaseScreen still actively used

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Consider:** Should `gift_rules_screen.dart` be part of the main gift flow?
2. **Consider:** Could the modal + full screen be better unified?
3. **Monitor:** Track which screen users prefer based on analytics
