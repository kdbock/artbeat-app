## Response to App Review Team

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**App:** ARTbeat  
**Guideline:** 5.1.1(v) - Data Collection and Storage  
**Issue:** Account deletion requirement

---

## Account Deletion Feature Location

The ARTbeat app **already includes** comprehensive account deletion functionality that fully complies with Apple's requirements:

### üìç **How to Access Account Deletion:**

1. Open the ARTbeat app
2. Navigate to **Settings** (main menu)
3. Scroll down to **"Quick Actions"** section
4. Tap **"Delete Account"** (red text with trash icon)
5. Confirm deletion in the dialog that appears

### ‚úÖ **Compliance Features Implemented:**

#### **Complete Account Deletion (Not Deactivation)**

- ‚úÖ **Permanent deletion** - not just deactivation or disabling
- ‚úÖ **All user data removed** from servers and storage
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Auth account deleted** - user cannot log back in with same credentials
- ‚úÖ **Cannot be undone** - meets Apple's permanence requirement

#### **Comprehensive Data Removal**

The deletion process removes:

- ‚úÖ User profile and account information
- ‚úÖ All uploaded files and images from cloud storage
- ‚úÖ Social connections (followers/following relationships)
- ‚úÖ User-generated content and associated data
- ‚úÖ Authentication credentials

#### **Security & Confirmation Steps**

- ‚úÖ **Confirmation dialog** prevents accidental deletion
- ‚úÖ **Re-authentication required** for recently inactive users (Firebase security)
- ‚úÖ **Clear warning** that action cannot be undone
- ‚úÖ **Immediate effect** - no waiting periods or additional steps required

#### **User Experience**

- ‚úÖ **Easily accessible** from main Settings menu
- ‚úÖ **No external website required** - complete in-app process
- ‚úÖ **Clear UI indicators** with appropriate warning colors and icons
- ‚úÖ **Success/error feedback** provided to user

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Location:

- **UI Implementation:** `/packages/artbeat_settings/lib/src/screens/settings_screen.dart`
- **Backend Logic:** `/packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/services/user_service.dart`

### Deletion Process:

1. **Storage Cleanup:** Removes all user files from Firebase Storage
2. **Database Cleanup:** Deletes user document from Firestore
3. **Relationship Cleanup:** Removes social connections and followers
4. **Auth Cleanup:** Deletes Firebase Authentication account
5. **Local Cleanup:** Clears cached data and signs out user

### Error Handling:

- Handles re-authentication requirements for security
- Provides clear error messages for network issues
- Graceful degradation if partial deletion occurs

## Industry Compliance

ARTbeat operates as a **general social media/art sharing platform** and is **not in a highly-regulated industry**, therefore:

- ‚úÖ No customer service requirements needed
- ‚úÖ No phone calls or emails required
- ‚úÖ Immediate in-app deletion is appropriate and implemented

---

## Conclusion

The ARTbeat app fully complies with Apple App Store Guideline 5.1.1(v). Account deletion is easily accessible through the Settings menu and provides complete, permanent removal of all user data without requiring external processes or customer service interactions.

**The feature is currently live and functional in the submitted app version 2.3.0 (build 57).**
