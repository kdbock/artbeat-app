# App Store Compliance Fixes - ArtBeat Gift System

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Guideline 3.1.1 - In-App Purchase Compliance** ✅

**Problem**: The gifting system was using Stripe instead of in-app purchase, violating Apple's requirement that all digital content/services payments use IAP.

**Solution**: Migrated the gift purchase system to use iOS/Android native in-app purchase.

### 2. **Guideline 2.3 - Metadata Accuracy** ✅

**Problem**: App metadata mentioned a "Gifting System powered by Stripe" but the feature wasn't properly implemented or not using Apple-compliant payment methods.

**Solution**: Updated implementation to use in-app purchase, ensuring metadata accuracy.

## Changes Made

### File: `packages/artbeat_community/lib/screens/gifts/gift_modal.dart`

#### **Before (Non-Compliant - Used Stripe)**

```dart
import 'package:artbeat_core/src/services/enhanced_payment_service_working.dart'
    show EnhancedPaymentService, PaymentResult;

class _GiftModalState extends State<GiftModal> {
  final EnhancedPaymentService _paymentService = EnhancedPaymentService();
  // ... Stripe-based payment processing
}
```

#### **After (Apple Compliant - Uses IAP)**

```dart
import 'package:artbeat_core/src/services/in_app_gift_service.dart';

class _GiftModalState extends State<GiftModal> {
  final InAppGiftService _giftService = InAppGiftService();
  // ... In-app purchase-based payment processing
}
```

### **Specific Updates**

1. **Replaced payment service**

   - ❌ Removed: `EnhancedPaymentService` (Stripe-based)
   - ✅ Added: `InAppGiftService` (IAP-based)

2. **Updated gift product configuration**

   ```dart
   // Now uses in-app purchase product IDs
   final List<Map<String, dynamic>> _giftOptions = [
     {'productId': 'artbeat_gift_small', 'type': 'Small Gift', 'amount': 5.0},
     {'productId': 'artbeat_gift_medium', 'type': 'Medium Gift', 'amount': 10.0},
     {'productId': 'artbeat_gift_large', 'type': 'Large Gift', 'amount': 25.0},
     {'productId': 'artbeat_gift_premium', 'type': 'Premium Gift', 'amount': 50.0},
   ];
   ```

3. **Simplified gift purchase method**

   - ✅ Removed: `_processGiftPayment()` (Stripe payment intent logic)
   - ✅ Removed: `_createGiftPaymentIntent()` (Stripe API calls)
   - ✅ Removed: `_logGiftTransaction()` (Stripe-specific logging)
   - ✅ Updated: `_sendGift()` to use `InAppGiftService.purchaseGift()`

4. **Updated payment flow**
   ```dart
   // Old: Made HTTP calls to Stripe via Firebase Cloud Functions
   // New: Calls native IAP via InAppGiftService
   final success = await _giftService.purchaseGift(
     recipientId: widget.recipientId,
     giftProductId: giftProductId,
     message: 'A gift from an ArtBeat user',
   );
   ```

## In-App Purchase Products (Already Configured)

The `InAppGiftService` uses these product IDs:

| Product ID             | Amount | Credits | Description  |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| `artbeat_gift_small`   | $5.00  | 50      | Small Gift   |
| `artbeat_gift_medium`  | $10.00 | 100     | Medium Gift  |
| `artbeat_gift_large`   | $25.00 | 250     | Large Gift   |
| `artbeat_gift_premium` | $50.00 | 500     | Premium Gift |

**These products must be configured in:**

- ✅ Apple App Store Connect (iOS)
- ✅ Google Play Console (Android)

## Response for Apple Review

**For Guideline 3.1.1:**

> "We have updated our gifting system to exclusively use in-app purchase for all gift transactions. The app now routes all gift purchases through the native iOS StoreKit and Android BillingClient APIs. Users can purchase gifts in amounts of $5, $10, $25, and $50, all processed through the standard in-app purchase mechanism."

**For Guideline 2.3:**

> "We have updated the app metadata to accurately reflect that our gifting system uses in-app purchase. The feature is fully functional within the app for supporting artists through virtual gifts."

   ```

   - Tap gift button
   - Verify IAP flow initiates (may show sandbox payment UI)
   - Check Firebase for gift transaction record

2. **Android (Android Studio/Device)**

   ```bash
   flutter run -d Android
   ```

   - Repeat gift purchase flow
   - Verify BillingClient handles payment
   - Check Firebase records

3. **Firestore Verification**
   - Check `gifts` collection for new records
   - Verify gift credits added to recipient user
