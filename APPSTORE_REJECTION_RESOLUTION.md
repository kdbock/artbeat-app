# ArtBeat App Store Review Rejection - Resolution Summary

## Submission Details

- **Submission ID**: 6775f217-d6e0-4a49-8024-608def580762
- **Review Date**: October 27, 2025
- **App Version**: 1.0

---

## Issues Found & Resolved

### ❌ Issue 1: Guideline 3.1.1 - In-App Purchase Violation

**Original Problem:**

> "We noticed that your app allows users to send 'tips' associated with receiving content from digital content creators with a mechanism other than in-app purchase."

**Root Cause:**
The gift purchase system was routing payments through **Stripe** via Firebase Cloud Functions (`processGiftPayment` endpoint) instead of using Apple's in-app purchase system.

**✅ Resolution Implemented:**

- **Migrated** `gift_modal.dart` from `EnhancedPaymentService` (Stripe) to `InAppGiftService` (IAP)
- **All gift purchases** now route through native iOS StoreKit and Android BillingClient
- **Product IDs** configured: `artbeat_gift_small`, `artbeat_gift_medium`, `artbeat_gift_large`, `artbeat_gift_premium`

**File Changed:**

- `packages/artbeat_community/lib/screens/gifts/gift_modal.dart`

**Code Before:**

```dart
// ❌ STRIPE - NOT COMPLIANT
final EnhancedPaymentService _paymentService = EnhancedPaymentService();
final paymentResult = await _processGiftPayment(...);  // Calls Stripe Cloud Function
```

**Code After:**

```dart
// ✅ IAP - COMPLIANT
final InAppGiftService _giftService = InAppGiftService();
final success = await _giftService.purchaseGift(
  recipientId: recipientId,
  giftProductId: giftProductId,
  message: message,
);
```

### ❌ Issue 2: Guideline 2.3 - Metadata Accuracy

**Original Problem:**

> "We were unable to locate some of the features described in your metadata. Specifically, Gifting System: Support artists with virtual gifts powered by Stripe."

**Root Cause:**

- Feature was mentioned in app metadata but was using Stripe (not App Store compliant)
- Feature metadata referenced Stripe instead of in-app purchase

**✅ Resolution Implemented:**

- Updated implementation to use in-app purchase (now App Store compliant)
- Metadata now accurately describes the feature with correct payment method

**Action Required for Next Submission:**
Update your app metadata in App Store Connect:

- Remove: "powered by Stripe"
- Add: "Support artists with virtual gifts using in-app purchase"

                         ↓
                    Sends Notification

## What Was NOT Changed (Why)

These features were **not** modified because they're not mentioned in the rejection:

1. **Sponsorships** - If this also needs IAP migration, it should be addressed separately
2. **Commission payments** - These appear to be artist-to-artist, not user-to-artist tips
3. **General payment processing** - Only gift/tip transactions were addressed per the rejection

---

## Verification Script (Optional)

To verify the migration was successful:

```bash
# Check that no Stripe gift endpoints remain
grep -r "processGiftPayment" packages/artbeat_community/lib --include="*.dart"
# Should show only in in_app_purchase_service references

# Check that GiftModal uses InAppGiftService
grep "InAppGiftService" packages/artbeat_community/lib/screens/gifts/gift_modal.dart
# Should show import and initialization

# Check product IDs are correct
grep -r "artbeat_gift" packages/artbeat_core/lib --include="*.dart"
# Should show the 4 correct product IDs
```

## Questions?

If Apple returns the app with additional questions about the gift system:

- All gift transactions are logged in Firebase Firestore under `gifts` collection
- Receipts are validated through App Store/Google Play
- Gift credits are immediately applied to recipient accounts
- The system maintains audit trails for all transactions
