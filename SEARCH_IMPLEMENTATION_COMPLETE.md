## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Search for community post content - should show in results
- [ ] Search for gallery/venue name - should show locations
- [ ] Search for capture with title/tags - should filter by query
- [ ] Click filter chip for "Artist" - should show only artists
- [ ] Click "All" chip - should clear filters
- [ ] Change sort to "Recent" - should sort by date
- [ ] Close search and reopen - should show search history
- [ ] Tap history chip - should re-run that search
- [ ] Click "Clear History" - should empty history
- [ ] Search 5+ items - history should show recent 5

### Automated Tests Needed:

- Unit tests for `_searchCommunity()` method
- Unit tests for `_searchLocations()` method
- Unit tests for filter logic
- Unit tests for sort logic
- Integration test for full search flow

---

## 📈 Performance Impact

- **Search time**: No change (parallel futures maintained)
- **Results limit**: Still capped at 50 total items
- **Firestore queries**: +2 new collection queries (galleries, venues)
- **Caching**: Already implemented (15-min TTL)
- **Memory**: Minimal (filter state is small set<enum>)

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- All user input is toLowerCase() for case-insensitive search
- Firestore security rules should restrict collections as needed
- Community and location searches respect existing permissions
- Search history stored locally (SharedPreferences) - no server sync

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Run tests**: `flutter test` to ensure no regressions
2. **Manual testing**: Test each feature on device
3. **Code review**: Team review of implementation
4. **Firestore setup**: Create collections if needed (community_posts, galleries, venues, artist_directory)
5. **Update TODO.md**: Mark all 13 items as complete ✅
6. **Deploy**: Merge to main branch
