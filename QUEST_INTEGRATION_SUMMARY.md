## 📊 New Stats Tracked

The following stats are now automatically tracked in Firestore:

```javascript
users/{userId}/stats/
  challengesCompleted: number    // Incremented on each daily challenge completion
  weeklyGoalsCompleted: number   // Incremented on each weekly goal completion
```

These stats are used to determine badge eligibility and are updated atomically within transactions.
