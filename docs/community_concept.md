### 🌀 Echoes Replacement Concepts

**Alternative Concepts:**
- **Applause 👏**: Tap to send applause, with increasing intensity (1–5 claps)

```
## Applause System
Instead of traditional likes, Local Artbeat uses the Applause system:

```

## Feedback Threads
Every art post contains a structured discussion area:

```

---

### 💬 Studios

  - name, description, tags, privacy type, member list

```
## Studios
Studios are topic-based or location-based chat rooms:

```

---

### 🎁 Palette Gifts (Stripe)

**README Section:**
```
## Palette Gifts
Artists can receive themed gifts that carry real value:
- 🎨 Mini Palette ($1)
- 🖌️ Brush Pack ($5)
- 🖼️ Gallery Frame ($20)
- 🌟 Golden Canvas ($50+)
Processed via Stripe with instant payout to artists.
```

---

### 💸 Stripe Integration

```
## Commissions Hub
A bulletin board for custom art requests:
