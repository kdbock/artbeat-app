# ARTbeat Release Process

This document outlines the process for creating and publishing new releases of the ARTbeat app.

## Release Naming Convention

ARTbeat uses artistic themes for release names:

- **1.0.0: "Canvas"** - The foundational release (June 2025)
- Future releases will follow artistic themes (e.g., "Palette", "Gallery", "Exhibit", etc.)

## Version Numbering

ARTbeat follows semantic versioning:

- **Major version (X.0.0)**: Significant changes or redesigns
- **Minor version (1.X.0)**: New features and functionality
- **Patch version (1.0.X)**: Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Build number (+1)**: Increments with each submission to app stores

## Release Preparation Checklist

Before creating a new release:

1. **Code Freeze**:
   - Ensure all targeted features are complete
   - Run all tests and fix any critical bugs
   - Perform code reviews on all new changes

2. **Version Updates**:
   - Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
   - Choose an appropriate release name
   - Document changes in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`
   - Create app store specific notes in `docs/APP_STORE_NOTES.md`

3. **Final Testing**:
   - Test on multiple physical devices (Android and iOS)
   - Verify all core functionality works as expected
   - Check performance and memory usage
   - Review accessibility features

## Creating the Release

Use the release script to build packages for both platforms:

```bash
./scripts/create_release.sh
```

This script will:
1. Clean the build environment
2. Update version information
3. Build release packages for Android and iOS
4. Create a Git tag for the release
5. Organize all release artifacts in `build/releases/[version]-[name]/`

## Release Artifacts

A complete release includes:

- **Android App Bundle (.aab)**: For Play Store submission
- **Android APK (.apk)**: For direct distribution and testing
- **iOS IPA (.ipa)**: For App Store submission
- **Release Notes**: Documentation of changes and features

## Publishing the Release

### Google Play Store

1. Log in to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)
2. Navigate to ARTbeat app > Release > Production
3. Create new release and upload the AAB file
4. Add release notes from `APP_STORE_NOTES.md`
5. Submit for review

### Apple App Store

1. Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Navigate to ARTbeat app > App Store > iOS App
3. Create a new version with the current version number
4. Upload the IPA through Xcode or Transporter
5. Add release notes from `APP_STORE_NOTES.md`
6. Submit for review

## Post-Release

After publishing:

1. Push the Git tag to the remote repository
2. Create a release in GitHub with the release notes
3. Update internal documentation
4. Begin planning the next release cycle

## Hotfix Process

For critical issues requiring immediate fixes:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the release tag
2. Fix the issue and increment the patch version (e.g., 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1)
3. Follow an expedited version of the standard release process
4. Document the issue and resolution in the release notes

Remember to maintain the release signing keystore securely, as it's required for all future Android releases.
