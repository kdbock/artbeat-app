## Usage Examples

### Basic Payment Processing

```dart
final paymentService = EnhancedPaymentService();

final result = await paymentService.processPaymentWithRiskAssessment(
  paymentIntentClientSecret: clientSecret,
  amount: 29.99,
  currency: 'usd',
  metadata: {'item_type': 'artwork'},
);

if (result.success) {
  print('Risk Score: ${result.riskAssessment?.riskScore}');
}
```

### Digital Wallet Payment

```dart
final result = await paymentService.processDigitalWalletPayment(
  walletType: 'apple_pay',
  amount: 49.99,
  currency: 'usd',
);
```

### Enhanced Subscription

```dart
final result = await paymentService.createEnhancedSubscription(
  tier: SubscriptionTier.premium,
  paymentMethodId: 'pm_123',
);
```

## Security Features

### Fraud Detection

- Device fingerprinting using device_info_plus
- Payment pattern analysis
- Risk-based transaction monitoring
- Automated fraud attempt reporting

### Risk Assessment Factors

- Transaction amount analysis
- Payment frequency monitoring
- Device usage patterns
- Time-based risk evaluation
- User payment history

## Next Steps

### Phase 2 Recommendations

1. **Biometric Authentication**: Add local_auth for fingerprint/face ID
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement payment analytics dashboard
3. **Machine Learning**: Add ML-based fraud detection models
4. **Multi-currency Support**: Enhanced international payment processing
5. **Payment Recovery**: Implement failed payment retry mechanisms
