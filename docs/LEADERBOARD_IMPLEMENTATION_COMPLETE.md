## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```dart
class LeaderboardEntry {
  final String userId;
  final String displayName;
  final String? profileImageUrl;
  final int value;           // XP, captures, walks, etc.

}
```

### Database Queries

- Error handling for offline scenarios
- Real-time updates when data changes

### Performance Considerations

- Paginated results with configurable limits
- Cached network images for profile pictures
- Efficient list rendering with ListView.builder
- Background refresh without blocking UI

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firestore Structure

The leaderboard reads from existing user documents with these fields:

- `experiencePoints`: Total XP earned
- `capturesApproved`: Number of approved captures
- `walksCompleted`: Art walks completed
- `walksCreated`: Art walks created by user
- `level`: Current user level
- `displayName`: User's display name
- `profileImageUrl`: Profile picture URL (optional)

### Customization Options

- **Categories**: Easy to add new leaderboard categories
- **Limits**: Configurable number of users shown
- **Styling**: Customizable colors and layouts
- **Refresh**: Adjustable refresh intervals

## 📱 Usage Examples

### Navigation to Leaderboard

```dart
// From anywhere in the app
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/leaderboard');

// Or using the preview widget
LeaderboardPreviewWidget(
  onViewAll: () => Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/leaderboard'),
)
```

### Adding to Dashboard

```dart
// Already integrated in FluidDashboardScreen
if (viewModel.isAuthenticated && viewModel.currentUser != null)
  SliverToBoxAdapter(
    child: LeaderboardPreviewWidget(),
  ),
```
