# ARTbeat Test Cleanup Guide

## Test Structure Overview

The ARTbeat app follows a modular architecture with each module maintaining its own testing structure. This document provides guidance on cleaning up and maintaining the test files across modules.

## General Testing Approach

1. **Dependency Injection**: All services use dependency injection to allow for proper mocking during tests.
2. **Testable Service Classes**: Services have testable versions that expose injectable dependencies.
3. **Simplified Mocks**: We've moved away from complex Firebase mocking to a simplified approach.
4. **Test Runners**: Each module has an `all_tests.dart` file that runs all tests for that module.

## Test File Organization

Each module follows this test file organization:

```
test/
  ├── all_tests.dart                # Test runner for the module
  ├── module_name_test.dart         # High-level module tests
  ├── mocks/                        # Mock implementations
  │   ├── mocks.dart
  │   └── enhanced_mocks.dart
  ├── models/                       # Model tests
  │   └── model_name_test.dart
  ├── services/                     # Service tests
  │   ├── service_name_test.dart
  │   └── testable_service_name_test.dart
  └── widgets/                      # Widget tests
      └── widget_name_test.dart
```

## Common Test File Patterns

1. **Simple Tests**: Basic functionality tests without complex dependencies
   - Example: `settings_service_simple_test.dart`

2. **Testable Service Tests**: Tests using dependency injection
   - Example: `testable_settings_service_test.dart`

3. **Simplified Tests**: Alternative implementation with easier-to-use mocks
   - Example: `settings_service_for_testing_simplified_test.dart`

## Guidelines for Cleaning Up Test Files

### When to Remove a Test File

1. **Failing Tests**: Test files that consistently fail due to outdated implementations
2. **Duplicated Tests**: Test files that duplicate functionality already covered by another file
3. **Outdated Mocks**: Tests using outdated mock implementations incompatible with current APIs

### When to Keep a Test File

1. **Working Tests**: Test files that successfully run and validate functionality
2. **Unique Coverage**: Tests that cover functionality not tested elsewhere
3. **Improved Implementations**: Newer test implementations that follow best practices

## Known Test Issues

### Settings Module
- `enhanced_settings_service.dart` has inheritance issues with `TestableSettingsService`
- Widget tests need to be implemented for settings screens

### Art Walk Module
- `testable_art_walk_service_test.dart` has Firestore interface compatibility issues
- Need to update List<Object> to Iterable<Object> for Firebase SDK compatibility

### Community Module
- All tests working correctly as of June 2025

### Messaging Module
- All tests working correctly as of June 2025

## Next Steps

1. Fix interface compatibility issues in Art Walk module tests
2. Fix enhanced_settings_service inheritance issues
3. Add widget tests across all modules
4. Set up test coverage reporting

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Tests Simple**: Prefer simple tests over complex ones when possible
2. **Isolate Firebase Dependencies**: Use dependency injection to isolate Firebase dependencies
3. **Use Test Runners**: Always update the module's `all_tests.dart` when adding or removing tests
4. **Document Test Approaches**: Add comments explaining the testing approach used
