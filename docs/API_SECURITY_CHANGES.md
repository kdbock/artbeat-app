# API Key Security Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to improve API key security in the ARTbeat application. While our repository is private and the API keys are generally secure, we have implemented best practices by moving API keys to environment variables for better security and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
- Created `.env` and `.env.example` files in the project root
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets
- Created a production-ready template in `.env.production`

### 2. Environment Variable Loading
- Added `flutter_dotenv` package for loading environment variables
- Created custom `EnvLoader` utility for handling environment files in different contexts
- Implemented fallback mechanism for development environments

### 3. Secure API Key Access
- Created `AppConfig` utility class for centralized access to API keys
- Implemented error handling and fallback values
- Added secure getters for Firebase and Google Maps API keys

### 4. Firebase Options Update
- Modified `firebase_options.dart` to use environment variables
- Updated Android and iOS configuration to use dynamic API keys

### 5. Google Maps Integration
- Updated `DirectionsService` to use environment variable for API key
- Implemented secure initialization

### 6. Environment Validation
- Created `EnvValidator` utility for checking API keys at runtime
- Added user-friendly warning dialog for missing or placeholder keys
- Implemented detailed instructions for developers

### 7. Documentation
- Created `API_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md` with detailed setup instructions
- Updated main README with security notice
- Added guidance for CI/CD integration

## Security Benefits

1. **No hardcoded secrets**: API keys are no longer part of the source code
2. **Development safety**: Fallback mechanism prevents crashes during development
3. **CI/CD ready**: Production template for secure deployment
4. **Clear guidance**: Documentation helps all developers follow best practices

## Testing

The implementation has been tested in development mode with:
- Missing environment files (fallback works correctly)
- Placeholder API keys (appropriate warnings shown)
- Valid API keys (seamless operation)

## Next Steps

- Configure API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
- Implement Firebase App Check for additional security
- Set up monitoring for API key usage
- Create a key rotation schedule and process
