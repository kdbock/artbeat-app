## Artist CTA Widget Implementation Complete ✅

I have successfully implemented the "Are you an artist?" widget as a subscription entry point across all main dashboard screens accessible via bottom navigation.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created a new standardized Artist CTA Widget** (`artist_cta_widget.dart`):

   - `ArtistCTAWidget`: Full-featured version with gradient background, feature showcase, and pricing call-to-action
   - `CompactArtistCTAWidget`: Compact version for smaller spaces with condensed messaging
   - Both widgets automatically hide for users who are already artists or gallery owners
   - Navigation integration to subscription/artist onboarding flows

2. **Integrated into all 5 main dashboard screens**:

   - **Main Dashboard** (`fluid_dashboard_screen.dart`): Replaced existing artist CTA section with new standardized widget
   - **Art Walk Dashboard**: Added compact artist CTA widget
   - **Capture Dashboard**: Added compact artist CTA widget in sliver layout
   - **Community Dashboard**: Replaced existing "Are You An Artist" section with new compact widget
   - **Events Dashboard**: Added compact artist CTA widget

3. **Added to artbeat_core exports** for cross-package availability

### Key features:

- 🎨 **Attractive design** with gradient backgrounds and feature icons
- 📱 **Responsive layouts** for different screen contexts
- 🔍 **Smart visibility** - automatically hides for existing artists
- 💰 **Clear pricing** showing new 2025 pricing structure ($4.99/month starting)
- 🚀 **Conversion focused** with strong call-to-action messaging
- 🎯 **Consistent experience** across all dashboard screens

### Technical implementation:

- Uses `FutureBuilder` with `UserService().getCurrentUserModel()` for user type checking
- Integrates with existing navigation patterns (`/subscription/plans`, `/artist/onboarding`)
- Modern Flutter best practices with proper widget composition
- Handles both full and compact display modes for different contexts

This provides a consistent, professional entry point for subscription conversion throughout the app, strategically placed where users are most engaged with the platform.

The implementation is complete and all screens now feature the artist conversion widget as requested.
