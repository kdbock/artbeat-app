# Quest & Goals Compliance Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

Users were unable to complete quest/goal requirements because:

1. Quest cards didn't show HOW to complete tasks
2. Cards didn't link to WHERE actions could be performed
3. Discovery/capture cards weren't easily discoverable
4. Weekly goals didn't show detailed milestones

**Example:** Quest says "comment on 3 other users' art discoveries" but users didn't know:

- WHERE to find discoveries
- HOW to access comments
- WHAT to do next
