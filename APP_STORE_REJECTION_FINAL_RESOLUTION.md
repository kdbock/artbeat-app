### ‚úÖ **Issue 4: Advertisement Payment Compliance (Guideline 3.1.1)** - RESOLVED

**Problem:** Advertisement payments used Stripe (non-compliant) instead of IAP
**Solution:** Fixed payment routing to use IAP system
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Files Modified:**

- `packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/services/payment_strategy_service.dart`
- `packages/artbeat_ads/lib/src/screens/simple_ad_create_screen.dart`

**Key Changes:**

```dart
// BEFORE (Non-Compliant)
PaymentMethod _getAdsPaymentMethod(PurchaseType purchaseType) {
  // Advertising purchases must use Stripe (Apple forbids IAP for ads)
  return PaymentMethod.stripe; // ‚ùå WRONG
}

// AFTER (Compliant)
PaymentMethod _getAdsPaymentMethod(PurchaseType purchaseType) {
  // Advertising purchases are digital goods and MUST use IAP (Apple Guideline 3.1.1)
  return PaymentMethod.iap; // ‚úÖ CORRECT
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Issue 5: iPad Payment Bug (Guideline 2.1)** - LIKELY RESOLVED

**Problem:** Advertisement payment errors on iPad Air (5th gen) with iPadOS 26.0
**Analysis:** Since Issue 4 was caused by incorrect Stripe usage, and we've now switched to IAP, the iPad-specific payment errors should be resolved.

**Technical Reasoning:**

- The bug was likely related to Stripe payment sheet issues on iPad
- IAP uses Apple's native payment system (more stable on iPad)
- Extensive Stripe crash fixes were already implemented
- IAP is the recommended approach for all Apple devices

**Status:** üîÑ **LIKELY RESOLVED** (Requires testing to confirm)
