# Android Build Fix - CI/CD Configuration

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the following error:

```
File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.
```

## Root Cause

The `google-services.json` file contains Firebase configuration and credentials. For security reasons:

- It is correctly gitignored to prevent committing sensitive data
- It exists locally for development but not in the CI/CD environment
- The Android build process requires this file to complete

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Template File

Created `android/app/google-services.json.template` with:

- Correct JSON structure for Firebase configuration
- Placeholder/dummy values that are safe to commit
- Same package name to ensure build compatibility

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

Modified `.github/workflows/comprehensive_tests.yml` to:

- Detect when building for Android platform
- Automatically create `google-services.json` from template before build
- Only applies to CI builds (doesn't affect local development)

### 3. Added Documentation

Created `android/app/README_FIREBASE_CONFIG.md` with:

- Setup instructions for local development
- CI/CD configuration details
- Security best practices
- Future production deployment guidance

## Changes Made

### Files Created

1. `android/app/google-services.json.template` - Template configuration for CI builds
2. `android/app/README_FIREBASE_CONFIG.md` - Documentation

### Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/comprehensive_tests.yml` - Added step to create google-services.json during Android builds

## Testing

The next time the workflow runs, it will:

1. Check out the code
2. Set up Flutter and Android SDK
3. Copy the template file to create `google-services.json`
4. Successfully build the Android APK

## Security Notes

✅ The actual `google-services.json` remains gitignored
✅ The template contains only dummy values
✅ Local development is unaffected
✅ For production releases, use GitHub Secrets (documented in README)

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to trigger the workflow
3. Verify the Android build succeeds
4. (Optional) Set up GitHub Secrets for production deployments
