# âœ… Stripe Payment Setup Complete

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies

- Added `stripe` package to Firebase Functions (`package.json`)
- Added `cors` package for proper API handling
- Installed all missing dependencies

### 2. Firebase Functions Configuration

- Configured Stripe secret key in Firebase Functions config
- Updated `firebase.json` to include functions deployment settings
- Successfully deployed functions to Firebase

### 3. Client-Side Improvements

- Added proper Stripe initialization in `PaymentService`
- Integrated `EnvLoader` for environment variable management
- Added Stripe publishable key initialization
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages

### 4. Gift System Enhancements

- Updated `GiftModal` to use the controller pattern
- Added comprehensive error handling for payment failures
- Improved user feedback for different error scenarios

## Files Modified

### Firebase Functions

- `functions/package.json` - Added Stripe and CORS dependencies
- `functions/src/index.ts` - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- `functions/src/genkit-sample.ts` - Removed unused imports
- `firebase.json` - Added functions configuration

### Flutter App

- `packages/artbeat_core/lib/src/services/payment_service.dart` - Added Stripe initialization and better error handling
- `packages/artbeat_community/lib/controllers/gift_controller.dart` - Created new controller
- `packages/artbeat_community/lib/screens/gifts/gift_modal.dart` - Updated to use controller and improved error messages
- `lib/main.dart` - Added EnvLoader initialization

## Configuration Applied

- Stripe Secret Key: `sk_live_51QpJ6iAO5ulTKoAL...` (configured in Firebase Functions)
- Stripe Publishable Key: `pk_live_51QpJ6iAO5ulTKoAL...` (configured in Flutter app)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Gift Feature**: Try sending a gift in the app to verify everything works
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check Firebase Functions logs if any issues occur
3. **Add Payment Methods**: Users will need to add payment methods before sending gifts

## Testing

The app should now be able to:

- Create Stripe customers successfully
- Process gift payments
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Firebase Functions logs: `firebase functions:log`
2. Check Flutter debug console for client-side errors
3. Verify Stripe dashboard for payment activity
