# Capture System - Phase 1 Implementation Complete ✅

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete
**Date**: Current Session
**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Features

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Accomplishments

### 1. Created CaptureDetailViewerScreen

- **File**: `/packages/artbeat_capture/lib/src/screens/capture_detail_viewer_screen.dart`
- **Purpose**: Fetch and display existing captures with full details
- **Features**:
  - Fetches capture from Firestore by ID
  - Displays all capture metadata (image, title, artist, location, etc.)
  - Shows status, visibility, and creation date
  - Edit button (owner only)
  - Delete button (owner only) with confirmation
  - Share button integrated
  - Placeholder buttons for Like and Comment (coming Phase 2)
  - Responsive error handling
  - Loading states

### 2. Fixed Capture Detail Routing

- **File**: `/lib/src/routing/app_router.dart` (line 1303)
- **Changed**: From "not found" to actual route
- **Route**: `/capture/detail` accepts `captureId` parameter
- **Maps to**: `CaptureDetailViewerScreen`
- **Behavior**: Gets capture ID from route arguments, fetches capture, displays it

### 3. Updated Navigation in CapturesListScreen

- **File**: `/packages/artbeat_capture/lib/src/screens/captures_list_screen.dart` (line 101)
- **Changed**: From `Navigator.push` to `Navigator.pushNamed`
- **New Route**: Uses `/capture/detail` with `captureId` argument
- **Benefit**: Consistent routing throughout app

### 4. Verified MyCapturesScreen Navigation

- **File**: `/packages/artbeat_capture/lib/src/screens/my_captures_screen.dart` (line 285)
- **Status**: Already implemented correctly ✅
- **Route**: `/capture/detail` with `captureId` argument

### 5. Updated Package Exports

- **File**: `/packages/artbeat_capture/lib/artbeat_capture.dart`
- **Added**: Export for `CaptureDetailViewerScreen`
- **File**: `/packages/artbeat_capture/lib/src/screens/screens.dart`
- **Added**: Exports for new screens and previously missing exports

### 6. Created Comprehensive Documentation

- `CAPTURE_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` - Full system analysis
- `CAPTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed action plan

## 🎯 What Now Works

### User Flow: View a Capture

1. ✅ User is in "My Captures" or "Browse Captures"
2. ✅ User taps on a capture item
3. ✅ App navigates to `/capture/detail` with capture ID
4. ✅ CaptureDetailViewerScreen fetches capture from Firestore
5. ✅ Full capture details display
6. ✅ User can:
   - View all metadata (title, artist, type, medium, location)
   - See creation date and status
   - Share the capture
   - Edit capture (if owner)
   - Delete capture (if owner) with confirmation

   ```

3. **Test Browse Captures**

   ```

   - Nearby captures list should load
   - Tap on a capture
   - Detail view should open
   ```

4. **Test Edit/Delete (Owner)**

   - Delete button should appear
   - Tap delete → confirm dialog
   ```

5. **Test Share**
